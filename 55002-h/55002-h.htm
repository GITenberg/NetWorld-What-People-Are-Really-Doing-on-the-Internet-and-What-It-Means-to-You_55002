    <div>Transcriber’s Note:</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Each chapter heading featured graphical components that are not
readily rendered here. See the <a href='#endnote'>note</a> for an example.</p>

<p class='c001'>Footnotes appeared in a separate section at the end of the text,
with the note number restarting for each chapter. In this version,
those numbers are retained, but are prefixed with the chapter number,
e.g., 1.1, 2.5, 6.7, etc.</p>

<p class='c001'>There are blocks of text with dotted boundaries, sometime spanning
pages, which are inserted into the main text. These have been moved
to avoid falling on paragraph breaks, and sometimes joined where page
breaks occur. They are given here within a dashed border, in order
to call out their separate nature.</p>

<p class='c001'>Minor errors, attributable to the printer, have been corrected. Please
see the transcriber’s <a href='#endnote'>note</a> at the end of this text
for details regarding the handling of any textual issues encountered
during its preparation.</p>

<p class='c001'>There are many URLs in the text, given the topic, but it is unlikely
that any are still extant, given the publication date in 1995.</p>

<div class='htmlonly'>

<p class='c001'>Any corrections are indicated using an <ins class='correction' title='original'>underline</ins>
highlight. Placing the cursor over the correction will produce the
original text in a small popup.</p>

<div class='c005'>Current Events/Internet</div>

<p class='c006'>“A considerable achievement. You find
yourself wanting to read <cite>NetWorld!</cite>
even if you have no thought of baptism
into the great new scene.”
      —William F. Buckley, Jr.</p>
<p class='c007'>“David H. Rothman has done the best job yet of illustrating
exactly how and why the Internet will change the texture of
daily life. Most discussion of the information age is full of airy
generalizations. <cite>NetWorld!</cite> is full of specific, amusing, often
racy illustrations of how people around the world have already
put the Net’s possibilities to work. This is a very useful and
entertaining book.”
           —James Fallows
           Washington editor of the <cite>Atlantic Monthly</cite></p>
<p class='c008'><span class='xlarge'>Exploring Life on the Net</span></p>
<p class='c009'>Praised by the <cite>New York Times</cite> For his entertaining style, David H.
Rothman has written a lively, revealing, and sharp-eyed account of life
on the Net. Read how a handsome young librarian in Adelaide, Australia,
got engaged to a Kansas City woman he’d never met—except online.
Discover why net.censors and other interlopers could eventually cost
America billions of dollars. Learn how an Anglican priest uses the
Internet to “hear” confessions and help keep in touch with his flock.
From electronic libraries to the digitized cadaver of an executed killer,
<cite>NetWorld!</cite> covers everything that’s happening on the Net.</p>
<p class='c009'>Whether you surf nightly or know
the Net only secondhand, <cite>NetWorld!</cite>
will shed new light on the cultural
phenomenon that is engrossing
millions around the world.</p>

  <h2 class='c014'>A Note to Visitors <br /> (and Natives)</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c017'>Everyone in <cite>NetWorld!</cite> is real, even me. Chapter 1 tells
how to reach some good people who let their electronic
addresses go on the Web site for this book.</p>

<p class='c018'>In a few cases—most notably “Sue” and “Greg” in
Chapter 7—I’ve guarded my subjects’ privacy with aliases
and changes of identifying details. Asterisks show up after
the first occurrences of their revised names.</p>

<p class='c018'>Please note, too, that I’ve smoothed out people’s informal
online prose to accommodate the printed page. A
“smiley” on the Net is a good quick way to show a smile or
frown; but I couldn’t think of anything uglier in print than
a series of symbols such as :-). So even in quotes, I’ve used
them sparingly.</p>

<p class='c018'>I wish Mark Twain were alive and cruising the
Internet at 28.8 kilobits per second; I’d love to see how
he’d have handled net.dialect.</p>

  <h2 class='c014'>Acknowledgments</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c008'>Alison, step to the front! Alison Andrukow, a graduate
student at Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario,
served as my chief researcher on this project—discovering
a number of goodies ranging from Bianca’s
Smut Shack to arcane, Net-related policy studies.</p>

<p class='c001'>Jennifer Basye Sander, my editor at Prima Publishing,
working with associate acquisitions editor Alice Anderson
and the project editor, Steven Martin, provided many suggestions,
as did the publisher, Ben Dominitz. The latter
promoted this book, so to speak, from <cite>Digital America</cite> to
<cite>Digital World</cite>, and in time the title <cite>NetWorld!</cite> also came
from Ben. Surprise, you guys! You thought you were getting
a general book on computer technology, but wisely
you let me get caught up in the Net. <cite>Thanks!</cite></p>

<p class='c001'>Bill Adler and Lisa Swayne of Adler and Robin Books,
joined by Nick Anis, agented this book. Nancy Daisywheel
Breckenridge was the transcriptionist.</p>

<p class='c001'>Finally, I want to thank the many people who gave
their time by way of e-mail or otherwise. Lest I forget
some important ones here, I won’t list any names. But by
way of the references in the book itself, readers will learn
the identities of many.</p>

the return key, and, in big, bold Times Roman letters,
I see the latest from the Internet:</p>

<p class='c001'>Sitting atop a pile of books, a most ungeekish model
looks flawlessly nubile, as if part of a virtual reality
tableau conjured up for Hugh Hefner himself. <cite>Playboy’s</cite>
message is clear: What counts isn’t mastery of Telnet,
Gopher, Lynx, or other Net voodoo. Candidates should
mail or e-mail “a recent full-length body photo in a two-piece
bathing suit or less and a clear face shot.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The same day a famous hacker named Cliff Stoll goes
on a Washington radio station to promote his book <cite>Silicon
Snake Oil</cite>, which says the Internet steals too much time
from true learning and life.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>For better or worse—mostly better in my opinion,
egalitarian that I am—the Internet has Arrived.</p>

<p class='c001'>A quarter-century ago scientists dreamed up a predecessor
of the network to let computers jabber to each
other across the United States, even after a nuclear attack.
Fearless professors followed with electronic talk on topics
ranging from biology to poetry.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now it’s as if <em>everyone</em> is on the Internet—not just
<cite>Playboy</cite> but <cite>Penthouse</cite>, some Arizona lawyers who love to
inflict junk ads on the innocent, a Florida manicurist,
Democratic and Republican stalwarts, thousands of college
freshmen, punk teenagers, and elementary schoolers
in London, Singapore, Minnesota, Nova Scotia—you
name it. In one way or other, the Net ties in to smaller
networks ranging from local, bulletin board-style systems
to America Online, CompuServe, Prodigy, Delphi,
GEnie, Bitnet, Bix, eWorld, and MCI Mail.</p>

<p class='c001'>Fans of David Letterman and Jay Leno, the world’s
most famous talk-show rivals, are even duking it out online.
The cyberspace section of <cite>Newsweek</cite> regularly lists
the hottest attractions of the Internet—for example, the
best sites on the World Wide Web, the multimedia area
where you can see pictures and hear sound.</p>

<p class='c001'>Hollywood is gambling on a movie called <cite>The Net</cite>, and
<cite>Time</cite> and <cite>Newsweek</cite> have done several cover stories. Could
the <cite>Time</cite> curse be at work here? Is everything else downhill,
now that the Net has landed on The Cover? Not if you go by
the stats. Internet demographers love to squabble about the
exact number of people on the Internet, but at the very least,
some 25-30 million can reach it by way of electronic mail;
and in a few years, if the braver prophets are right, hundreds
of millions may be wired in. For the snobs, of course, the
old cachet is gone. A humor columnist says the Net is like
citizens band radio with typing.</p>

<p class='c001'>Is the Internet, then, about to become a 500,000-channel
wasteland? Just what are all these millions <em>really</em>
doing on the Net? Some politicians would have you think
that a disturbing number of Netfolks are busy corrupting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>the morals of minors, and shouldn’t we ban smut from
the public areas of cyberspace? And if you believe some
American security bureaucrats, the Net might turn out
to be a haven for spies and dope dealers. “Shouldn’t
Washington,” they more or less ask, “be able to snoop on
pervs and subversives who scramble their messages?”</p>

<p class='c001'>The counterrevolution has begun, and I feel grouchy.</p>

<p class='c001'>Everyone is trying to reinvent the Internet in his or her
own image, even if, with these changes, the Net would no
longer be the Net. What’s really pathetic is the ignorance
of the would-be meddlers. Censoring the Net would be
about as successful as trying to dam the Pacific. The same
decentralization that made the Net more nuke-resistant,
in the Cold War days, makes it harder to control. And how
can Washington sell the Net on Fed-friendly chips for
coded messages when scores of powerful encryption
products are on sale in Russia and the rest of Europe?</p>

<p class='c001'>At the same time, certain writers are now attacking
the Internet as Cold and Heartless, or for other sins; some
are even Pulling the Plug, at least temporarily, to protect
their delicate brains against Information Overload.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Don’t make me go back!” J. C. Hertz recalls telling
her editors when they wanted her to log back on the Net to
wind down a book called <cite>Surfing the Internet</cite>. “Please,
don’t make me go back there.” Stephen L. Talbott, a computer
editor and author of <cite>The Future Does Not Compute</cite>,
proclaims that he “immediately felt very good” when he
Unplugged. Bill Henderson of the Push Cart Press says
he’ll publish a book with “cries from the heart about what
electronics has done to people.”<a id='r1.1' /><a href='#f1.1' class='c022'><sup>[1.1]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Perhaps a new literary genre is aborning—that of the
Snubbites, the new Luddites<a id='r1.2' /><a href='#f1.2' class='c022'><sup>[1.2]</sup></a> who feel all Netted Up. The
definition might go something like this:</p>

<p class='c023'><em>Snubbite:—n. One who, partly out of snobbery,
partly out of boredom, partly out of sheer contrariness,
snubs the computer technology that could help
millions of others.</em></p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>A typical Snubbite is upper-middle class and very
possibly Ivy League. Snubbites could afford computer
and Internet connections—or more likely enjoyed them
at others’ expense—years before average people were
even allowed on the Net. Often Snubbites live near large
libraries or can catch up with books easily enough in
other ways. Snubbites may have already used the Net to
help stock up on their quota of friends and professional
contacts. Most Snubbites are harmless and even charmingly
eccentric; they worry me only when they start confusing
their own needs and non-needs with those of
society at large.</p>

<p class='c018'>Cliff Stoll himself is very much on the Internet (“I still
love my networked community”) even now; to this day, I
suspect, he truly enjoys seeing people home-brew their
own machines. But in stretches of his book he could almost
be mistaken for a Snubbite anyway, based on sheer
fervor. “It is an overpromoted, hollow world, devoid of
warmth and human kindness,” Stoll writes of cyberspace,
and goes on to say that nets address “few social needs or
business concerns” and threaten “precious parts of our
society, including schools, libraries, and social institutions.”
He complains, “No birds sing.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Have I been hallucinating? The Internet isn’t
Woodstock, the Vatican, or an aviary, but it is bringing together
people for religion, education, business, love, and
suicide prevention. Just what is Stoll writing about? Does
the Net have an evil twin? Jews, Moslems, Lutherans, and
Catholics—they are all using the Net to exchange prayers
or electronic newsletters. Up in Canada an Anglican priest
will even take confessions via e-mail. I doubt he’d agree
with the author of <cite>Snake Oil</cite>.</p>

<p class='c018'>Nor, I suspect, would the members of Walkers in
Darkness. Walkers is a mailing list for people with chronic
depression, and each week more than 300 messages whiz
across the Net from Australia to Israel, from South Africa to
California. I’m not depressed, but someone close to me is,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>and she spends hour after hour with her laptop, gazing at
the blue-and-white on the screen, reading scores of messages,
keeping up with the gossip about people and drugs,
wondering what she would do without her Net connection.
Being depressed is like kayaking or hang gliding: You
won’t die immediately if you skip the homework, but in a
pinch you’ll stand a much better chance if you’ve gone far
beyond the basics. Walkers is in the grand tradition of the
Net. Its members don’t blindingly trust authority figures—their
own shrinks—and they are reaching out to other patients
and to an online psychiatrist. Tell us, Ivan, some
Walkers ask, is Parnate as good a drug as it’s cracked up to
be? What about Nardil? Can you take it without your body
swelling up?</p>

<p class='c018'>“Ivan” is a well-credentialed psychopharmacologist
in New York City who helps out for free. Dr. Ivan
Goldberg doesn’t prescribe drugs for people online, but
he <em>will</em> report his own experiences with them after many
years of practice. He has a knack for coming up with angles
that patients’ own doctors might miss. After months
on Prozac, a man found his work slipping. Ivan Goldberg
told him of a new way—successful here, it turns out—to
treat the problem.</p>

<p class='c018'>Goldberg is online two hours a day “as a way of paying
back for the thirty-plus good years I have had from my
work with depressed people.”<a id='r1.3' /><a href='#f1.3' class='c022'><sup>[1.3]</sup></a> After several years on the
Net helping virtual support groups, he has won the respect
of hundreds and perhaps even thousands.</p>

<p class='c018'>Still, Walkers compare notes with each other and don’t
accept even Ivan Goldberg’s opinions automatically. Just
as if they were talking over the office watercooler, they
weigh the validity of the information themselves. But what
a collection of facts! When a new antidepressant shows up
in Canada or the United Kingdom, Walkers learn about it
many weeks before the news reaches the daily papers in
the States, assuming that word makes their daily newspapers
at all.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>Many of the best conversations, however, aren’t about
drugs or the merits or perils of electroconvulsive shock
treatments. They’re about other Walkers. Remember the
gay Walker in Iowa who was so quick to welcome newcomers
and answer questions? Well, here’s his obit: <em>Died
of complications from diabetes</em>. How about the fellow on
the East Coast, the programmer who never logs on with a
name? Is he okay, after his last suicide attempt? Is somebody
going to drop by to visit him in the hospital? What
about such-and-such’s cat? How’s your new girlfriend? Is
your landlord being reasonable? The questions and answers
fly across the wires. Walkers may not be as famous
a virtual community as The WELL, Echo, and similar
bulletin board systems with Net and media connections,
but it’s hardly as if the luminaries of those places enjoy a
monopoly on Caring.</p>

<p class='c018'>Later that morning I hear Cliff Stoll push his book on
WAMU radio. It’s a slaughter; the call-ins run against him
by at least five to one. I even feel a little sorry for him until
I remember that the technophobes at many bookstores
may outnumber the technophiles. The full title of the book
is <cite>Silicon Snake Oil: Second Thoughts on the Information
Highway</cite>, and it should be just the ticket for Luddites and
Snubbites with spare change. I myself have Second
Thoughts about his Second Thoughts. Early on in his
book he says: “I look forward to the time when our
Internet reaches into every town and trailer park.” But his
true emphasis comes through. Just how much of a
technopopulist is he in the end when he claims that networks
will “isolate us from one another” and “work
against literacy and creativity?”</p>

<p class='c018'>What’s really freaky is that a woman from Walkers or
a similar discussion group—out of all the thousands on
the Net—calls up <cite>The Diane <a id='corr6.34'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Rehme'>Rehm</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_6.34'><ins class='correction' title='Rehme'>Rehm</ins></a></span> Show</cite> and ever so politely
shreds the arguments that Stoll has made in <cite>Oil</cite>. A
few years ago he wrote <cite>The Cuckoo’s Egg</cite>, a wonderful
book about his battles against errant hackers, and parts of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span><cite>Snake Oil</cite> do ring true, but oh how wrong he is about the
more cosmic issues. Confronted with the Walkers-style
example, Stoll acknowledges that, yes, maybe the Net
could be of use to people who need support. After all, the
very anonymity he’s assailed can work in favor of honest
dialogue. Exactly. One of the glories of Walkers, however,
is that depressed people can be as open or nameless as
they want. What’s more, they can even go Face to Face.
Several Walkers near me, for example, will spend hours
and hours talking in person with others dogged by this
scourge of Lincoln and Churchill.</p>

<p class='c018'>Dave Harmon is the man behind the Walkers list. He’s
a twenty-eight-year-old Harvard grad, bearded, bespectacled,
and a little on the heavy side, as he describes it. I
learn that he works as a programmer for a company that
writes software to use with mice—the computer kind. His
depression is moderate. Come the middle of the night, he
may wake up in a cold sweat; he can also suffer flagging
energy.</p>

<p class='c018'>Several years ago Harmon was crouched in a Boston
bus shelter, enjoying a break from a crowded but rainy
New Year’s Eve celebration, when he took out a notebook
and wrote a poem. “I am the Walker in Darkness,” it read
in part, “I am the bringer of light.” The next day Harmon
called the company that had hooked him into the
Internet—he wanted to start a list for depressed people interested
in art and magic. “The thing that makes the Net
so powerful is that you don’t have to get into a big deal to
start a minor newsgroup or a mailing list.” The newsgroups
and the mailing lists can precisely reflect Netfolks’
interests, loves, and fears—much more closely than, say,
CBS or the <cite>New York Times</cite>, or even niche programs on
cable.</p>

      <div class='line'>Oklahoma City and the</div>
      <div class='line'>Ban-the-Bomb-Manual Panic</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>
<p class='c024'>A citation for <cite>The Terrorist’s Handbook</cite> popped up
on my screen a minute after I started a search of the
World Wide Web under the word “explosives.” I apparently
would be able to make “book bombs,”
“lightbulb bombs,” “phone bombs.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Trying to retrieve the <cite>Handbook</cite> some weeks
later, I read the following: “Are you sure this resource
exists?” Cute. The heat is on. <cite>Handbook</cite>-style
items caught the attention of the U.S. Senate after
sickos blew up a federal building in Oklahoma City
and killed 160 people. The response in effect was:
“Ban the bomb manuals—from the Net and otherwise!”
and as of this writing, it looked as if such sentiments
might end up as law. Still, a little problem
arose in the case of <cite>The Terrorist’s Handbook</cite> on the
Net. The material was coming to me from Lysator, a
respected academic computer society at Linköping
University in Linköping, <em>Sweden</em>. Last I knew, the
U.S. Senate did not enjoy jurisdiction over its counterparts
in Stockholm.</p>

<p class='c018'>The Swedish computer that stored <cite>The Terrorist’s
Handbook</cite>, however, contains megabyte after megabyte
of valuable material on computing and other
subjects, and the electronic librarians didn’t want to
anger the university. So out of prudence, they voluntarily
removed the bomb manual after hysterical stories
appeared in the press. The <cite>Handbook</cite> wasn’t
worth the fuss.</p>

<p class='c018'>Perhaps in other cases Washington will use diplomacy
with other countries to unplug <cite>Handbook</cite>-style
items. But no one should count on this approach
working in the end. Inevitably the same material will
be secretly making the rounds of obscure electronic
bulletin board systems, as opposed to the Net
itself. As if that isn’t enough, Washington has unwittingly
given out instructions for bomb-makers
by way of the tax-financed <cite>Blaster’s Handbook</cite> from
the Forestry Service in the U.S. Department of
Agriculture. Even <cite>The Encyclopedia Britannica</cite> has
printed material on explosive making.</p>

<p class='c018'>Most disturbing of all, Constitutional issues arise
here. We don’t need the government to restrain free
speech. As writer Brock N. Meeks wrote in his
<cite>CyberWire Dispatch</cite> newsletter, Senator Dianne
Feinstein’s proposal was “a break in the dike.” It was
“the trickle that could become a river of regulatory
hammers meant to turn the rough-and-tumble, open
and free-flowing online discourse into something
with all the appeal and intellectual acumen of tofu.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>Newsgroups are a bit like local bulletin board systems
except that some newsgroups reach hundreds of
thousands of people around the world. Mailing lists are
more intimate than newsgroups since you usually need
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>to sign up for them electronically before you receive the
messages.</p>

<p class='c018'>“The funny thing,” Harmon says of freshly created
mailing lists, “is that you never know what will result.
What I found was that most depressed people couldn’t
produce that much art and mysticism, but they were interested
in supporting each other, and I looked at that and let
it go on its own.”</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>A seventy-eight-year-old widow in the American
South discovered Harmon’s list. She was the first in her
family, after several generations of mental illness, to seek
psychiatric help. People from Singapore have popped up,
too, reporting how they were stigmatized as lazy by people
unable to understand the energy-sapping qualities of
the disease. Walkers tell of spouses complaining about the
loss of sex drive from depression or medications. Simply
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>put, Harmon’s list has not just helped people cope with a
disease, but it has also helped those who can’t understand
it. And as shown by the Singaporean example, geography
has been inconsequential for the most part. “When you’re
depressed,” Harmon says, “it doesn’t matter where you’re
from, you’re still depressed.”</p>

<p class='c018'>What’s more, Walkers can log on as often or seldom as
they want. Frequently the depressed feel all “peopled up,”
so they may flee into their rooms and close the blinds
when visitors approach. But with Walkers messages, all
they need do is press the delete key. The Internet isn’t just
a medium of special benefit to the deaf; it’s also one for the
seriously depressed, many of whom, if made Netless,
might try to do without <em>any</em> company offline.</p>

<p class='c018'>As with thousands of other Net lists, people come and
go, some of them overwhelmed by the sheer volume of
messages; Stoll is right to characterize the Internet as like
trying to drink water from a fire hydrant. But a core of
stalwarts remain enthusiastically on Walkers, and along
with Harmon and Goldberg, they’re rather small-townish
in cyberspace in the best of ways. I ask about the East
Coast Walker with suicidal tendencies. Harmon says that
by the time the supportive messages reached the man, the
programmer had already called 911 and gone to the hospital
to have his stomach pumped.</p>

<p class='c018'>But, yes, Harmon says, Walkers has indeed saved lives.
“A more usual situation is that someone is considering suicide
and issues an appeal to Walkers for help. They’ll say
something to the effect that ‘It’s not worth it, and nothing I
do ever works, and I’m probably bothering you with this
note.’ People respond to it and sometime call the person by
phone if the number is available.” If the number isn’t,
Harmon and other Netheads will try to use their knowledge
of the Internet to track it down. “We don’t breach privacy
unless there really is a suicide threat, and sometimes
people’s accounts may be on services where we can’t find
them. More usually, various people may send their own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>phone numbers either privately or to someone or to the
list, so that other members can reach them.</p>

<p class='c018'>“The Internet,” he cautions, “is <em>not</em> always a fast-rescuer—you
may be lucky to get same-day service. In the
programmer’s case his note didn’t even get <em>to</em> my list for an
hour, much less get sent out to all the members. <em>I</em> found
out about his note by getting a midnight phone call!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Still, Harmon sees the Net as a godsend for ongoing
support and as a crisis aid even if the help isn’t always immediate.
Goldberg agrees: “It’s mobilized people to all
kinds of interventions.”<a id='r1.4' /><a href='#f1.4' class='c022'><sup>[1.4]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c018'>“I’m sitting here with a knife in my hand,” wrote a
community college student asking for support from
Walkers. “Don’t worry, I’m not going to kill myself—just
hurt myself a little. I just feel as though I deserve pain.”
She went on to tell how she had been in the National
Honor Society in high school, gone on to an honors program
at Loyola University for several years, then had
been forced to leave. “I used to be strong, brilliant, and
ambitious and now I am stupid and manic depressive. It
just hurts so much. So I guess that’s why I’m cutting on
my wrists tonight.” She told me when I wrote to ask
about her condition—improved—that “I would be lost
without Walkers.”</p>

<p class='c018'>A near-suicide in Santa Clara, California, aided by the
newsgroup alt.support.depression, recalls: “I was so close
it was amazing.” Medical debts had overwhelmed him. He
was a single father and his boss had put him on probation
after child care gobbled up too much work time. In tears
he began his note: “It doesn’t really matter any more.” A
New York woman saw the note and begged people online
to help. Hundreds of messages came over the Net from as
far as Japan. Tracked down despite his unsigned post, the
California man received help not only from a colleague at
work but also from police. “Something snapped,” he recalls,
“and I just realized that there were a lot of people
there who cared.”<a id='r1.5' /><a href='#f1.5' class='c022'><sup>[1.5]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>Madness, another self-help group on the Net, is a
mailing list for people who suffer drastic mood swings,
hear voices, and see visions. Now, says Sylvia Caras, who
runs the list, they can use the Net to carry on a dialogue
with federal mental health officials. The Net offers a very
<em>real</em> voice for those the world might otherwise ignore.</p>

<p class='c018'>I could go on forever about support groups on the Net.
Whether you’re short or extra tall, anorexic or 300 pounds,
a victim of cancer or of child abuse, the Internet teems
with people wanting to share their experiences with you—a
task made much easier through the efficiencies of the
Net, which have brought the cost of electronic mail down
so much. I bristle when I hear people talk about the
Internet as worthless unless big profits await megaconglomerates.
The activities of support groups and other virtual
communities may not show up in any country’s gross
domestic product, but in the aggregate they’re just as
valuable as anything to emerge from AT&amp;T or Time
Warner.</p>

<p class='c018'>May I emphasize that the Net is far, far more than a
mental health clinic? It’s a place, too, for political activists,
boaters, golfers, motorcyclists, gun owners, gourmets,
football fans, baseball enthusiasts, parents and teachers,
writers and readers of many genres, pilots, airline passengers,
amateur radio operators, and reggae lovers. All have
their own niches, which is just what you’d expect with
more than 12,000 newsgroups.</p>

<p class='c018'>While the clueless are arguing over whether the Net
has value, people like John Schwartz already know it
does. Recently he wondered about lyrics by a singer and
songwriter named Liz Phair. Just how did they go? Some
of the biggest fun came from his hunt online. He tracked
down at least five different Web areas—“digital fan magazines”—devoted
to Phair. “Some had photos, some had biographical
information, and a couple had song lyrics.”
And yes, he found the lyrics he wanted, and in their full,
unprintable glory. “Useless? Probably. Satisfying? You
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>bet.” And Schwartz went on: “Think of all the stuff that
you’d find in your public library if you pulled something
off the shelf. A lot of it would be ‘useless’ for your own
needs—tons of mediocre fiction, outdated information,
and silly things. But would anybody say that it proves that
libraries are worthless?”<a id='r1.6' /><a href='#f1.6' class='c022'><sup>[1.6]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c018'>Other Net activities also suggest that <cite>Snake Oil</cite> is
self-descriptive. A Michigan couple has started a virtual
toy store complete with pictures of their staffers as children
and service of the kind you’d expect from L. L.
Bean; their first order came from Brazil (see chapter 2:
<a id='corr13.21'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='“Business'>Business</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_13.21'><ins class='correction' title='“Business'>Business</ins></a></span> on the Net: From White Rabbit Toys to “Intel
Inside”). Out in California two young techies are giving
hundreds of young musicians a break through a much-needed
project called the Internet Underground Music
Archives (chapter 3: EntertaiNet: A Few Musings on
Net.Rock, Leonardo da Vinci and Bill Gates, Bianca’s Smut
Shack, and David Letterman in Cyberspace). Just throw
$100 their way and, for a year, you can post a sample of
your music on the Net and perhaps stir up sales of old cassettes
and CDs.</p>

<p class='c018'>At the same time that Stoll grouses that the Internet is
unedited, scores of dailies and weeklies are on the Net to
one extent or another (chapter 4: Pulped Wood versus
Electrons: Can the Print World Learn to Love the Net?).
So’s <cite>Time</cite> magazine. Random House, Macmillan, and
Time Warner are there, too, posting samples from various
books, and soon people at home will be able to send credit
card numbers securely over the Net and dial up the complete
texts of bestsellers and other books. Even now you
just might be reading <cite>NetWorld!</cite> off a screen rather than
from pulped wood.</p>

<p class='c018'>Meanwhile, a digitized cadaver on the Internet may
help revolutionize the study of anatomy (<a href='#chap5'>chapter 5</a>: Wired
Knowledge: When They Let a Murderer Loose on the
Internet), and in Canada, leather-jacketed teenagers are
using the Net to develop their reading and writing skills.</p>

<p class='c018'>A Mini Jargon Guide</p>

</div>

<p class='c025'>• Electronic Mail or e-mail. You can use the Net and
other networks to send messages to your friends
in Peoria or Melbourne—anywhere, in fact,
where Internet connections go, from Alaska to the
South Pole. An electronic mailbox is just like the
physical equivalent. It’s a little storage area where
your messages pile up for you to retrieve when
you want.</p>

<p class='c025'>• File Transfer Protocol, or FTP. It’s a means to send
or receive files from one computer to another.</p>

<p class='c025'>• Gopher. This program lets you track down information
on the Net. The word <cite>Gopher</cite> also alludes
to certain Gopher-style collections of computer
files. Different Gophers connect to each other
through items on menus. You might start looking
at an article on water pollution from a computer
in Washington, D.C., see a mention of an African
river, click on that menu choice with your mouse
or otherwise select it, and end up at a computer in
Johannesburg.</p>

<p class='c025'>• Internet Relay Chat. It’s like a huge party line except
that people are typing rather than talking.
You can open up private areas, too, and reach just
one person.</p>

<p class='c025'>• Mailing Lists. To be a bit simplistic, they’re just
like regular electronic mail, except that a number
of people share messages, to which you can typically
respond privately or with the entire list.
Some lists, however, let only the <em>moderator</em> send
out messages. Via Usenet, some mailing lists appear
as newsgroups.</p>

<p class='c025'>• Newsgroups. These are the bulletin board systems
of the Net, in effect. Almost anyone can post messages
there and potentially reach hundreds of
thousands of people—far more than on most mailing
lists, since people can read newsgroups without
subscribing. The newsgroups are part of a
service called Usenet, which reaches BBSs around
the world, not just the Internet. No one owns this
anarchy, and I wouldn’t want it any other way.</p>

<p class='c025'>• Telnet. Without leaving my regular keyboard I
can operate a computer at Oxford University or
the University of California by way of a procedure
called Telnet. I’m remotely controlling the machines
at the other end.</p>

<p class='c025'>• The World Wide Web. It’s the area of the Net that
not only lets you read text but also see pictures,
hear sounds, and even take in short clips from
movies. Like Gophers, sites on the World Wide
Web connect with each other. A program that lets
you navigate the Web is known as a browser.
Among the more popular browsers are Mosaic,
Netscape, and Lynx (the latter, alas, won’t let you
instantly enjoy pictures).</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>Also, the Net, in the opinion of many, is mocking Orwell’s
predictions (chapter 6: Governments and the Net: Making
Sure Orwell Was Wrong). Some serious threats remain—such
as the efforts of American bureaucrats to make the
Net more friendly to snoopy cops—but 1995 is a long way
from <cite>1984</cite>. What’s more, the Internet doesn’t offer just sex.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>Love, too, can thrive. The persistent may indeed find
wives and husbands on the Net (chapter 7: The Electronic
Matchmaker).</p>

<p class='c018'>This all happens on my Internet—anyway the one I’ll
describe here. Let me offer an inevitable caveat, however:
The Net is too vast for one writer to cover everything. So I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>won’t bother with Internet Relay Chat, where you instantly
see the other people’s typing. As a temporary habitué of
these regions, J. C. Hertz started to regard the Internet as “a
Sartrean hell—too many people talking at one time.”<a id='r1.7' /><a href='#f1.7' class='c022'><sup>[1.7]</sup></a> Yes!
Net chat brings Hemingwayesque accounts from witnesses
to Japanese earthquakes or Russian coups, and I’m happy
it’s around for the aficionados, especially net.lovers, who
can retreat to their own private channels; but I myself
favor electronic mail and newsgroups, which I can read
on my own terms without parrying incessantly with dyspeptic
strangers half a planet removed. I promise, dear
readers: I’ll inflict nary a chat transcript on you.</p>

<p class='c018'>Certain omissions, however, really pain me. Given
more time, I’d have loved to cover the growth of the community
network movement. For free, in many cities, you
can open up an Internet account and tap into electronic libraries
all over the world or receive electronic mail. Best
of all, “communets” can bring communities together. The
Net is one of the big lures to get people online, but once
there, they may be able to fetch the schedule of their local
public radio stations, find out about local charities, and
talk back electronically to officials of city halls.</p>

<p class='c018'>What’s fascinating is the resemblance between these
local nets and the Net at large. People on both would
rather chat with other citizens than swap e-mail with the
politicians or other celebrities. And why not? Communets
are communities, just as the Net, serving so many interests,
is a <em>series</em> of communities. Alas, Stoll does not appreciate
the possibilities here.</p>

<p class='c018'>Stoll is an astronomer, not just a hacker, and his  makes me feel as if he is using a scratchy pair of binoculars
to look for life on Mars. Fixated on negatives, he
has downplayed even the obvious: the Net equivalent of
Martian mountains. Has Stoll dropped by alt.music.chapel-hill,
or rec.arts.dance, or alt.christnet.christianlife, or the
Dallas Virtual Jewish Community Center Home Page, or
the American Ireland Fund, or the Voter Education Project?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>And how about the thousands of other Web pages in which
individual Netfolks can share with the world their love of
families and pets, or gardening, or ,
or old Chevies, or whatever else they enjoy, at or away
from their computers? Item by item, those are tiny, almost
invisible slices of Netlife; but en masse, they rise up as
mountains.</p>

<p class='c018'>Yes, yes, sex <em>areas</em> thrive on the Internet. But it is that
way offline, too; do snack-food stores turn millions each
year off Chaucer or <cite>Playboy</cite>? Of course Chaucer himself
could be randy at times, as could Shakespeare and Joyce
and hundreds of other literary greats—an inconvenient
fact for the American ayatollahs who hope to censor
the Net.</p>

<p class='c018'>The biggest irony here is that the Internet can actually
promote Family Values and strengthen real neighborhoods.
As George Gilder and others have noted, the new
technology can serve people’s exact needs rather than just
dish out the standard sex and violence so beloved to TV
networks. The Net is Example One in my opinion—especially
The Barcroft School and Civic League page on
the World Wide Web. Several thousand people live in the
Barcroft area of Arlington, Virginia, near Washington, D.C.
It’s neither a slum nor a glitzy, status-crazed neighborhood,
just a good place to raise the families that the ayatollahs
love to extol. An old Methodist church has served as a
community house. Now an electronic equivalent is on the
Web, complete with a color photo of the church building;
people can catch up with neighborhood news and learn of
ice cream socials.</p>

<p class='c018'>I’m writing this paragraph just before the Barcroft
Fourth of July parade. The word from the World Wide
Web is that Susan O’Hara Christopher will be the Grand
Marshall. People can enjoy Nancy Tankersley’s watercolors
of past parades, or “Jim Lande’s famous tree trunk
sculpture. Games for the kids, no political campaigning,
hot dogs and lemonade, the new Barcroft tee shirts and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>lots more!” The higher the percentage of Netfolks among
the citizenry, the more Fourth of July bulletins we’ll see in
cyberspace.</p>

<p class='c018'>Across the Potomac in D.C., the Internet is helping to
reduce the number of hookers and drug pushers plying
the Blagden Alley neighborhood. If the police catch you
looking for women or dope, a man named Paul Warren
will put your name on the World Wide Web. Thanks to his
“Crimenet,” residents no longer stand as much a chance
of finding a hooker at work on the sidewalk a few yards
from toddlers in living rooms. Not everyone would approve
of the privacy implications here, but I myself love
what Warren is doing. Like thousands of small-town
newspapers that print the names of the arrested, Warren
is just spreading around the public record. A notice reminds
readers that “Criminal defendants are presumed
innocent until proven guilty”; and he is willing to post an
update for anyone exonerated. Warren isn’t saying that
prostitution should be illegal everywhere, just that it
should not force young families out of Blagden Alley.</p>

<p class='c018'>That, in fact, is how I feel about net.sex. If a fifth
grader encountered alt.sex.bestiality whenever he or she
flicked on a computer, why, yes, I’d join the ayatollahs.
But the Net is not like the pre-Web Blagden Alley or daytime
television. You normally don’t find sex on the Net—at
least not the truly kinky type—unless you seek it out. And
the computer industry is working on software to reduce
the chances of children accidentally running across
alt.sex.bestiality. Even now, of course, the language in the
average area of the Net is much cleaner than the words in
the locker room of the typical high school. Trying to ban
“smut” from the Internet would be like shutting down
high school football because <em>some</em> sixteen-year-old tackles
love to cuss at teammates and gawk at nude pictures.</p>

<p class='c018'>Granted, the Net has problems, and rather serious
ones. A Californian stole 20,000 credit card numbers from
Net users; in New York some young men met through the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>Net and figured out ways to order tens of thousands of dollars
in merchandise illegally. Many Netfolks think it’s too
risky to send credit card numbers over the Net itself when
ordering merchandise; better to use the telephone or fax.
What’s more, just as Stoll says, business on the Net is overhyped.
Meanwhile the Feds have reduced subsidies to the
Net. Over in Australia there are already bothersome
charges for use according to the amount of material transmitted,
and people fear that the same could happen in the
States.</p>

<p class='c018'>Just as frustratingly, the technology isn’t quite there
yet. Pictures can take centuries to appear on my screen
when I fetch material on the World Wide Web. I hook into
the Internet by dialing up ClarkNet, a company in a barn
south of Baltimore. This is one of the <em>best</em> services, but a
good part of the time, in recent months, I’ve suffered a
busy signal or worse when I try to dial in. Given the overcrowding
of the Net, electronic mail takes longer to arrive
than it once did. I believe Stoll when he says that in some
cases the United States Postal Service will get mail from
one place to the other faster than the Net will handle
e-mail. That’s the exception, but I’m disturbed to see it
happen even part of the time.</p>

<p class='c018'>I lament, too, the lack of commercial books available
on the Net for free, in the public library tradition. Cliff Stoll
is absolutely right to want better content, and my friend
Jim Besser would agree with us. Jim is a journalist avid
for new facts; he regrets that so much of the information
on the Net is wrong or out of date. Beyond that, his
Internet connection sometimes goes south when he is
under a deadline.</p>

<p class='c018'>Cures for the Internet’s problems, however, are or
could be on the way. Technology will make the Net safer to
use and more reliable—lo and behold, the computers in
the barn have behaved somewhat better these past few
weeks. Over the long run, too, Netlife will improve. Popular
programs in some cases, even now, are letting customers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>send credit card numbers online without the hackers intercepting
them. Net businesses will take off when more
people sign on and young hackers get jobs and families.</p>

<p class='c018'>The Internet will even survive the reduction of subsidies
from Washington. The price of the technology will
just keep going down if past trends apply, and if the government
doesn’t let phone companies gouge people.
Everything is faster and cheaper. Once the experts
doubted that ordinary phone lines could carry signals at
9.6 kilobits, or 9,600 bits, per second. Today, even if I’m not
IBM or the phone company, I can cruise along at around
28.8 kilobits per second, which is enough to receive a
book in a few minutes.</p>

<p class='c018'>If Cliff Stoll really wants electronic books, then computer
networks can transmit them. When, just when, will
Washington be brave enough to work toward a well-stocked
national digital library offering commercial books
for all; why should we replicate online the “savage inequalities”
of our libraries and schools?</p>

<p class='c018'>Netfolks aren’t the reason why such a library for the
Internet is so far off right now, and why we may well end
up with a national digital bookstore as opposed to a true
library offering books at no charge or at minimal cost.
Even technophobic librarians—they exist, even if not in
the same numbers as before—aren’t the true villains here.
<em>Lobbyists</em> are at fault. Bill Clinton’s intellectual property
czar, Bruce Lehman, is himself a former lawyer-lobbyist
who acts as if he is still fighting for his old copyright
clients. Members of his former law firm have donated tens
of thousands of dollars to influential politicians. And in a
five-year period people with corporate or family ties to a
legal publisher, West Publishing in Minnesota, have given
more than $738,000 in political contributions, some of
which went to members of Congress influential on copyright
matters.</p>

<p class='c018'>With less eagerness to please lobbyists pushing for
corporate business plans—rather than for the commonweal—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>U.S. government could divert resources from
bureaucracy to knowledge and pay publishers and writers
fairly. How? Suppose Washington would link the national
library with a focused program to buy hardware
that schools and local libraries could lend out. In effect
the Feds would prime the private market by encouraging
mass production and by sending a message about priorities.
Small, tablet-shaped computers with extra-sharp
screens could eventually go on sale—much sooner than
otherwise—for $99.95 at Kmart. And these same machines,
although designed for reading electronic books,
would be excellent for the Net or for filling out easy electronic
forms; we could save tens of billions in money and
time in the private and public sectors of America’s $6-trillion
economy. Needless to say, too, this affordable
hardware could mean more eyes for retail businesses on
the Internet.</p>

<p class='c018'>Then high tech wouldn’t pose such a problem to nontechie
consumers and to computerphobic women and
minorities. A study out of the Georgia Institute of Technology
showed that 94 percent of the surveyed users on
the Web were male and 87 percent were white. With less-threatening
hardware and proper training of the right
people, however, schools and neighborhood libraries
could help bring a much wider segment of society on the
Net. Cliff Stoll is aware of the possibilities here. He knew
two years ago of my TeleRead proposal to improve the
content of the Net, get many more people online, and
spread the electronic books around from the very start.
How much easier it must be for him to eulogize old
wooden card catalogues and avoid a nasty tangle with lobbyist-cowed
politicians and bureaucrats.</p>

<p class='c018'>Bashing technology, of course, is hardly new. In 1854 a
writer complained: “We are in great haste to construct a
magnetic telegraph from Maine to Texas; but Maine and
Texas, it may be, have nothing important to communicate.”
He said that “We are eager to tunnel under the Atlantic and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>bring the Old World some weeks nearer to the New; but
perchance the first news that will leak through to the
broad, flapping American ear will be that Princess
Adelaide has the whooping cough.”<a id='r1.8' /><a href='#f1.8' class='c022'><sup>[1.8]</sup></a> Henry David Thoreau
was the writer and the words appeared in <cite>Walden</cite>.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>Does their source, however, make them less dubious?
Hardly. Imagine America without the telegraph—without
an opportunity to forge lucrative commercial ties with the
Old World, or to strengthen Texas’s ties to Washington. As
it turned out, Texas and the rest of the country had plenty
to say. So did railroad employees talking to each other;
companies could more easily use single tracks to handle
traffic in both directions, knowing that the telegraph was
there to handle scheduling.<a id='r1.9' /><a href='#f1.9' class='c022'><sup>[1.9]</sup></a> In other fields, such as medicine,
the telegraph undoubtedly hastened progress as
well. It also helped friends and families keep in touch as
the country was settled; today the Net does the same with
people in this era of international travel. Technology, then,
while ripe with opportunities for abuse, can do far more
than recruit “Girls of the Net” or spread word of a
princess’s whooping cough.</p>

<p class='c018'>Ironically, if the Cliff Stolls prevail, and if too many
white hats abandon the nets as “devoid of warmth and
human kindness,” then his predictions <em>will</em> come to pass;
the greedy will take over, confident that others won’t mind
so much.</p>

<p class='c018'>Together with millions of other Netfolks, I’ll remember
the Great Spamming of ’94. Laurence A. Canter and
Martha S. Siegel, husband-and-wife partners in an Arizona
law firm called Canter and Siegel, wanted to sell their
services as immigration experts. So they splattered a
“Green Card” ad—as if hurling spam against a wall—across
some 6,000 newsgroups on Usenet. They didn’t
care if you preferred to read about baseball or UNIX; they
wanted your eyeballs. The Net seethed. I myself disliked
many of the tactics used against Canter and Siegel—was
it really necessary to threaten death or favor them with a
slew of unsought magazine subscriptions?—but clearly
they merited some good, strong, healthy loathing. I complained
to the American Bar Association, which, at the
time, was spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on a
PR campaign to upgrade the image of lawyers. You might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>say that C &amp; S set the goodwill account back by several
million.</p>

<p class='c018'>My big regret is that I lacked more time to raise hell
against Canter and his wife online and in other ways. The
glory of the Net, this <em>series</em> of communities, was and is diversity;
here C &amp; S were dumbing it down to the broadcast
model where one program served all. But Canter and
Siegel didn’t give a whit about the Net as it existed, about
the outrage that so many unwilling people were bearing
the costs of sending and storing their unwanted messages,
about the fact that Usenet couldn’t survive continued assaults
in this vein, about the damage they were doing to
the various forms of Net culture, a phrase that C &amp; S
would undoubtedly have dismissed as an oxymoron.</p>

<p class='c018'>Canter and Siegel later added to the insult with <cite>How
to Make a Fortune on the Information Superhighway</cite>, the
1990s equivalent of a guide to exterminating buffalo.<a id='r1.10' /><a href='#f1.10' class='c022'><sup>[1.10]</sup></a>
The book talked of selling to 30 million people, which
was malarkey. Some Net demographers challenged the
figure at the time—reality may finally have caught up—but
more important, most of those 30 million could only
send and receive electronic mail as opposed to using services
such as the World Wide Web. And just how many
people wanted to receive junk mail from marketers? Of
course C &amp; S might suggest mailing lists for the receptive—nothing
wrong there—but without access to the
right Net services, fewer people would know of the lists
in the first place.</p>

<p class='c018'>Does this mean that the Internet should be free of
commerce? Quite the opposite. The challenge is simply to
avoid letting the hardsellers overwhelm the Internet.
Countless areas of the Net exist where people not only tolerate
ads, they <em>want</em> to read them. Besides, the commercial
and noncommercial can build on each other. When I
put my TeleRead proposal on the World Wide Web—that
is, my call for a well-stocked national digital library with
copyrighted books included—I built in hypertext links<a id='r1.11' /><a href='#f1.11' class='c022'><sup>[1.11]</sup></a> to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>Web sites that could be useful. And several just happened
to be commercial. The Minneapolis <cite>Star Tribune</cite>, for example,
had done a Pulitzer-quality expose of the thousands
of dollars that West Publishing had doled out in
trips for some Supreme Court justices who passed judgment
on copyright matters. Just why should I have
avoided this superb material when a commercial publication
was good enough to share it with the Net for free?</p>

<p class='c018'>Electronic cafes, found in San Francisco, Seattle,
London, and Hong Kong, among other locations, are another
good example of how the commercial and noncommercial
can strengthen each other. Cafes with Internet
hookups can even help bridge the gap between Net and
life. The Internet Cafe at 1363 4th Avenue in Prince
George, British Columbia, doesn’t just offer a coffee bar.
Customers of the local Internet provider can pick up their
e-mail there and wander around the Net, read “a good,
old-fashioned cork bulletin board for community information
exchanges,” learn about local service agencies,
watch resident artists at work, buy crafts from all over the
world, and even get advice from a local psychologist, Russ
Winterbotham, who just happens to own the place.</p>

<p class='c018'>When Stoll writes about an Ontario bookstore with a
water garden and three cats, it’s easy to appreciate the potential
charms of commerce offline. But clearly the Net itself
can spice up a traditional business. In London, you
can drop by the Cyberia cafe at 39 Whitfield Street and
plunk down £1.50 for a large cappuccino and £2.50 for a
half-hour on the Net. The word is that the cafe has drawn
“more media coverage than a small war.” I’m not surprised.
Even if prices might be a bit lower by my standards,
Cyberia is meeting a definite need. Of course Stoll
would complain that the customers in the electronic cafes
are “surrounded by people, yet escaping into conversations
with distant strangers.” Isn’t he forgetting something,
however: The way many Net aficionados love to
meet the like-minded in person?</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>I’m also keen, needless to say, on the pioneering work
that thousands of small businesses are doing on the World
Wide Web itself—rather than posting in-your-face ads to
nonrelevant newsgroups.</p>

<p class='c018'>No, Web businesses aren’t charities or consumer service
organizations. But by offering details about their
products and services, they are respecting our intelligence
far more than does the huckstery on television. You
wouldn’t want to buy a new Buick or Volvo if you simply
went by statistics and photos on the Web. But you just
might learn more about gas mileage and safety claims
than if you relied simply on the sales rep and brochures in
the showroom. The more you shop this way, the more
you’ll encourage manufacturers to improve their products
and services rather than just to shell out megabucks on
more Super Bowl ads. Net business, major limitations
notwithstanding, is indeed A Good Thing.</p>

<p class='c018'>Our first stop in <cite>NetWorld!</cite>, in fact, might well be one of
my favorite stores in cyberspace—White Rabbit Toys.</p>

  </div>
</div>

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c017'>Bob Lilienfeld worked for Procter &amp; Gamble and the
outfit behind the Muppets, and JoAnn Lilienfeld was
a buyer at Bloomingdale’s. Nowadays he consults on
solid waste and other environmental issues. His wife, a
neatly coifed woman who looks and dresses like an upscale
schoolteacher,<a id='r2.1' /><a href='#f2.1' class='c022'><sup>[2.1]</sup></a> has started a toy store called White
Rabbit Toys in honor of the character in <cite>Alice’s Adventures
in Wonderland</cite>. Bob enjoys technology. JoAnn herself is no
slouch in that area. They are in their forties now but relish
new marketing wrinkles just as much as when they were
earning their MBAs from Northwestern University.</p>

<p class='c018'>So Bob and JoAnn Lilienfeld have set up shop on the
Internet, where, in a surprising but logical way that a
mathematician like Lewis Carroll would have loved, their
respective business ventures mesh.</p>

<p class='c018'>Wandering through commercial listings on the Web, I
discovered the virtual White Rabbit just as Christmas
shoppers were crowding the corporeal White Rabbit up in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>Ann Arbor, Michigan. Bob was a technohusband par excellence.
He designed the toy store online, claimed just
the right address on the World Wide Web (http://www.toystore.com),
wrestled with the technical issues, and
helped take orders from customers, the first of whom
lived in Brazil. JoAnn would pay Bob in his favorite currency:
teddy bears. The big question was: Will they make
any money at it? I electronically hung around their virtual
store and chatted with Bob on the phone as the season
progressed.</p>

<p class='c018'>He and his wife were among the thousands of small
business people who were trying new marketing paradigms
on the Net, where the denizens hated intrusive
huckstery but might take to electronic catalogues.</p>

<p class='c018'>Compared to most other business people on the
Internet, the Lilienfelds were quick studies. You could type
an electronic address into your computer and see a White
Rabbit logo and a greeting from the toy store in several
languages. Then you clicked your mouse on the proper
area of your screen and opened up a colorful catalogue
with not only blurbs but also pictures of tops and puzzles
and wooden toy trains of the kind your parents might have
bought for you. Most of White Rabbit’s offerings were classics
that you would never see at Toys <span class='large'>ᴙ</span> Us.</p>

<p class='c018'>Bob and JoAnn Lilienfeld wanted their business to
stand out. Soon their electronic forms might let you type
in the age of your child, information about his or her interests,
your budget, and other constraints. You would
instantly receive tips on what gifts to buy. Even now, you
could order online without talking to a human—not as
heartless as it might sound, if you simply valued your
time and telephone money. The electronic forms could
even calculate the postage.</p>

<p class='c018'>White Rabbit intrigued me, and others felt the same
way. Within a few weeks of my first visit, they got calls
from the <cite>Wall Street Journal</cite> and the <cite>Detroit Free Press</cite>.
Some reporters had caught on to the obvious: While
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>Hollywood and Washington were off prattling clichés
about the overpriced medium called interactive TV—while
Al Gore was cracking jokes on stage with Lily Tomlin during
an entertainment summit disguised as an “information”
one—entrepreneurs and Fortune 500 companies
were trying ads on the Net. The Internet often narrows differences
between large and small businesses. Even little
ones can reach global audiences and, through well-planned
Web areas, look like giants to customers in Rio or
Tokyo. New cybermalls sprout up to get technophobic
companies online by providing both technical and creative
services. Corporations fight over addresses for the Net.
Stanley Kaplan, a service that tutors students for academic
examinations such as the Scholastic Aptitude Test, sued a
competitor that stole the name kaplan.com. A writer for
<cite>Wired</cite> magazine mischievously claimed McDonald’s
name, which the hamburger chain hadn’t yet registered.
Such oversights, however, were rapidly becoming the exception
in an era when prime Web sites made the pages of
<cite>Newsweek</cite>.</p>

<p class='c018'>Even electronic hookers (“We go all the way”) were on
the Internet—in fact, operating under the name “Brandy’s
Babes.” They plied their trade from Arizona, the same wild
and quirky state from which Canter and Siegel enraged the
Net. And yet, if you cast the usual moral questions aside, the
Babes seemed to be exemplary citizens of cyberspace. Not
just hypesters, they posted specifics like prices, bust, hip,
and waist measurements, and preferences in men. “No
beards,” a Babe warned customers. “Employed men only.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Unlike the hardsellers, the Babes did not inflict unwanted
ads on thousands of newsgroups. And in line with
the two-way traditions of the Net, they solicited messages
from customers—dirty ones that the Babes might charge
good money to answer. You could even dial up Brandy’s
and see a live Babe at her computer with her impressive
bosom exposed. The gig lasted several zany months. Fear
of police raids grew, however, even before the ayatollahs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>in the U.S. Senate ranted against net.sex. I finally saw just
a blank screen except for a laconic message alluding to
“bad links.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Separately a condom store was online as well. It offered
medical information, supplied tantalizing odds and
ends on such topics as “The Size of a Man’s Pony,” and
wittily answered questions from appreciative readers.
Like Brandy’s, it operated in a nonintrusive way.</p>

<p class='c018'>The World Wide Web was also a virtual home for
thousands of more conventional businesses such as the
manufacturer of a toy gun that shot Ping-Pong balls, a
city’s worth of bookstores, Godiva chocolate, and Ragu
spaghetti. None other than the Home Shopping Network
bought out a Net retailer specializing in computer equipment.
Pizza Hut went online. And the United States was
hardly alone in this trend. The Singaporeans were competing
in the cyberpizza race—Shakey’s Pizza was girding
to take orders, via a fax-Net link, from hungry scientists
and students at the National University of Singapore. A
large Irish bank advertised on the Net. So did the Royal
Bank of Canada. It mounted a bilingual Web area for both
English- and French-speaking customers who, once past
the first menu, didn’t have to clutter their screens with
material in the wrong language.</p>

<p class='c018'>Some of the old technical barriers, of course, remained
even in rich countries: most hardware was still rotten for
doing home shopping. What the customers needed, and
what Silicon Valley could not yet provide, happened to be
small, affordable, sharp-screened computers that could
colorfully show off the merchandise. The main way to look
at the Net was through Mosaic-style programs. And even at
28.8 kilobits per second—the highest speed possible
through widely available modems—it took too long to go
from page to page of electronic catalogues. The biggest
problem was the software installation, which could be
tricky. Although software such as Internet in a Box simplified
the matters, the Net was not yet TV-easy to use.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>Even so, some companies were designing inexpensive
gadgets, which could sell for mere hundreds of dollars,
that would allow people to surf the Internet on their televisions.
I hated the idea of anyone reading text off a blurry
television screen. But at least the powers of the computer
world were finally thinking of the Internet as a real, live
marketplace. Just as important, Prodigy, America Online,
CompuServe, and rivals were preparing to let customers
reach Web sites from their proprietary networks.</p>

<p class='c018'>Microsoft was planning point-and-click Internet capabilities
for its Windows 95 operating system. And it had
bought stock in a key Internet provider and would be linking
its own network tightly with the Net. <cite>Advertising Age</cite>
estimated the number of people able to access the Web itself—the
best place for Net advertising—at several million
at the start of 1995.<a id='r2.2' /><a href='#f2.2' class='c022'><sup>[2.2]</sup></a> And that number might push past 11
million by 1998, according to a report from a
Massachusetts research firm.<a id='r2.3' /><a href='#f2.3' class='c022'><sup>[2.3]</sup></a> So, even if Internet merchants
aren’t advertising in the most consumer-oriented
of places right now, they might well be awash in new
business later on.</p>

<p class='c018'>The existing denizens of the Internet were more technical
than the people on, say, Prodigy or America Online.
Some software companies used this to their great advantage.
A good example was Cyberspace Development Company,
which had created an extraordinarily useful program
called The Internet Adapter, or TIA. Most Net people
couldn’t enjoy Mosaic-style viewers because their network
connections did not allow this. But TIA let even Netfolks
with $18-a-month accounts use Mosaic and other marvels.
And to buy TIA, they did not have to go to a retail store.</p>

<p class='c018'>If technically savvy, they could pick it up on the
Internet itself. A digital key, transmitted via e-mail, allowed
only authorized customers to use the publicly available
files. Skeptics could try a test version of TIA for a few
weeks before paying for it by check or credit card.
Because of the low cost of distribution and, in my case, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>lack of need for full consulting services, I spent just $25 on
a product that might have cost a good $50-$75 if sold at
the usual store. And by normally using a basic hookup
with my Web software—as opposed to a deluxe, time-sensitive
one—I could save hundreds of dollars a year.</p>

<p class='c018'>The benefits of the Internet, for the Cyberspace
Development Company and me, didn’t stop there. Via discussion
groups, TIA sellers kept us customers up to date,
and just as important, we could share tips among ourselves.
We could also use the World Wide Web to catch up with long
documents; in fact, updated versions of TIA could travel to
us over the Net. All of this, including the elimination of the
need to go to the store, was taking place on commercial networks
such as CompuServe. But the costs would have been
greater for Cyberspace and customers alike if the company
had to pay the usual commercial rates for electronic mail.</p>

<p class='c018'>Among the wares talked up online were upbeat prognostications
about the Net itself. For $3,500 you could buy
a report from a California consulting firm that said annual
commerce on the Net and commercials services such as
CompuServe would reach $600 billion by the turn of the
century. I was skeptical. Merchants like JoAnn Lilienfeld
would have to sell warehouse after warehouse of stuffed
animals or toys or whatever the offerings were. In fact,
$600 billion was a good 8 percent of international commerce.
On reflection, however, the estimate from Killen &amp;
Associates seemed possible. Through the Net you might
find a buyer for shipload of scrap iron or an office building,
not just a stray teddy bear in need of a child. I phoned
Mary Cronin of Boston College, who had written a well-regarded
book called <cite>Doing Business on the Internet</cite>. It
teemed with examples from Digital Equipment Corporation
and IBM and many other computer-oriented
firms. And she had researched it before most business
people grasped the importance of the Internet. Yes, she
said, the $600 billion figure sounded credible if you
counted business-to-business transactions.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>Daniel Dern, an Internet consultant, had his own
opinion on the statistics. He said the Net was like the highway.
Just what did you count—all the goods that went over
the road? The combined salaries of the people on the way
to work? I could see his point.</p>

<p class='c018'>Whatever the exact numbers, the demographics and
technology might be on the side of the many retail businesses
if they stuck it out on the Net and kept expectations
realistic. Scads of people in Generation Net were about to
marry. They would buy houses and cars and whatever
else mattered beyond stereos and Internet-optimized
computers. Just in the late summer and fall of 1994, the
number of Net-related businesses on the Web had doubled,
and a good many of the newcomers were not technical.
Could the Net really, then, enrich business people
without technical backgrounds? Was there indeed money
in what had once been the province of cash-strapped college
students and dreamy researchers?</p>

<p class='c018'>Plenty of people thought that the answer lay in the
case history of Grant’s Flowers, which, like White Rabbit
Toys, operated out of Ann Arbor, Michigan. Larry Grant
had been a cover boy in an enticing article on the front
page of the business section of the <cite>New York Times</cite>; the
Internet pulsed with chatter about the electronic coups
that he supposedly had achieved for just $28 a month.
Excited Netfolks reported that he did not even have to type
to his customers on the Internet; new orders just poured
in on a fax machine with a Net connection. The California
gold rush was almost a century and a half old. And yet,
watching the Grant legend take off, I might as well have
been among the boots and beards at Sutter’s Mill.</p>

<p class='c018'>So I talked not only to the Lilienfelds but to Larry Grant,
the legendary florist himself. Many in the media were still
enchanted with the Electronic Frontier metaphor, and I
remembered the old films about Davy Crockett, the
Tennessee frontiersman who loved corny jokes, bear-wrestling
tales, coonskin hats, and Crockett-friendly news
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>accounts—the grist for Walt Disney later on. What was
next, a movie epic with a musical tribute to “Larry Grant,
king of the Net frontier”?</p>

<p class='c018'>A market might indeed be ballooning for cyber-retailers,
as the hypesters said. But I still wondered about
the present. What counted was not all the puffery about 30
million Netfolks, many of whom can only read electronic
mail as opposed to <em>seeing</em> roses or toy tops or other merchandise.
No, the real determinant was how often people
dial up your particular site and bought. One well-crafted
Web area, which advertised technically related goods, enjoyed
just a handful of visits in six months without a single
sale. This was an issue aside from the total amount of
business done on the Net. Having talked with Mary
Cronin and others, I hadn’t any doubt about those giant
commodity transactions and all the use of the Net by Big
Business to automate the paperwork of commerce. But
what about the small fry? Was the excitement about Grant
truly justified? I’ll answer those questions in the pages
ahead, where I’ll return to the Lilienfelds and to Grant,
and where I’ll examine the following:</p>

<p class='c025'>• MCI, the phone company. It has provided thousands of
miles of Net connections and now rents out electronic
storefronts on the Net. MCI offers one of the slickest
Web areas—complete with a fictitious publishing house
(now evolving into a real one) that accepts manuscripts
from real readers. <cite>Advertising Age</cite> has hailed the MCI
site as “unquestionably the best Internet marketing effort
to date.” Frustratingly, however, while preparing to
dispense advice on cyberspace, MCI in early 1995 was
committing some of the very mistakes it should be
telling its customers to avoid.</p>

<p class='c025'>• Federal Express, whose Internet presence shows the potential
of the Net for business-to-business transactions,
not just the consumer variety. Ironically the people at
FedEx in some ways were demonstrating more Net
savvy than MCI was at the time, even though the Internet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>was more in the territory of the latter. The old values of
customer service still reigned above all else. A smaller
competitor of Federal Express, a shipper called Right-O-Way,
was also making outstanding use of the Net. In
some ways it was even staying ahead of the big boys.</p>

<p class='c025'>• Intel, the chipmaker, which learned the hard way how
good the Internet was for spreading news of flaws in
products. The Net abounds with skeptical academics
and consumerists with <em>fast</em> typing fingers.</p>

<p class='c025'>• Other hazards of the Internet for business people. What
if you set up an electronic storefront like the Lilienfelds’
and then a manufacturer decided to cut out the middle
people and sell on the Net directly or through a larger
outlet? Security is another threat. While I was writing
<cite>NetWorld!</cite>, most commercial areas on the Net lacked a
way to protect credit card numbers. Hackers broke into
General Electric’s Web area and stole corporate secrets.
Another risk is competitors looking over price lists and
assessing the strengths and weaknesses of products.</p>

<p class='c018'>Those caveats will end the chapter. By far, the Internet
is a positive rather than a negative factor for business and
customers alike. Wired consumers will reward good companies,
punish the losers, and spur the winners to do still
better.</p>

<p class='c018'>Thousands of miles to the south of Ann Arbor, home
of White Rabbit Toys, Luciana Gores was reading a popular
mailing list called Net Happenings. It was a kind of
town crier. Each day from North Dakota a man named
Gleason Sackman sent out informative posts on the many
new services that were springing up on the Internet.</p>

<p class='c018'>Gores worked as a network expert, and she was already
used to buying technical books through the Internet,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>which offered a far greater variety than what she would
find in her own city, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.</p>

<p class='c018'>She was also the mother of a seven-year-old named
Lucas. So when the mailing list told her of White Rabbit,
she checked it out on the Web.</p>

<p class='c018'>People who visited the virtual store, or at least those
with the right equipment, saw a logo with the rabbit from
Lewis Caroll’s imagination. They also conjured up a color
picture of a real toy store with shelf after shelf of tot
pleasers, a tiny table and stool on the floor, and a look of
friendly chaos—in short, a shopper’s delight for children
and parents alike, which in fact the “real” White Rabbit
was. The traditional store, the one at 2611 Plymouth Road,
had thrived. Now Bob and JoAnn Lilienfeld were trying to
woo virtual customers such as Luciana Gores. Their electronic
White Rabbit just may have been the first full-service
toy store—as opposed to one-product billboards or
specialty shops—to open up on the Internet.</p>

<p class='c018'>An ad on the opening screen helped set the tone for
Luciana Gores and other customers of White Rabbit: “We
specialize in high-quality toys that help children to create,
learn, imagine, and explore. Our toys come from all over
the world. We offer such international favorites as Brio
(Sweden), Ravensburger (Germany), Primetime Playthings
and Creativity for Kids (United States).”</p>

<p class='c018'>Suitably equipped customers could actually see pictures
of the toys, including a Ravensburger game called the
A-maze-ing Labyrinth. “Travel the corridors of the enchanted
labyrinth in search of treasures,” read the carnival-like
pitch. “But watch out! The walls shift, and the
passages can close, leaving you trapped! For ages eight and
older.” Lucas was a year younger, but did it matter if the
child was as bright as his mother, the network expert? “It
seems to be an interesting game,” Luciana Gores e-mailed
me, “and it won a Parent’s Choice award.” And so she paid
her $24.95 and shipping, which, given the light weight of
the toy, was modest.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>Thanks to the Internet, the Lilienfelds suddenly had
the whole world as a market, not just customers living
near by. The fact that White Rabbit was in a university
town, with graduates all over the planet, could only help.
So could the fact that the Internet was expanding overseas
even more rapidly than in the United States.</p>

<p class='c018'>White Rabbit also appealed to Stuart Lowry, another
promising kind of customer—the computer jock turned
family man. A Maryland resident in his late twenties, he
wouldn’t have made the pulses of marketers quicken several
years ago; he was a grad student then at Johns
Hopkins University and, like many people on the Internet,
had more time than money. But that had changed. Lowry
now worked at Computer Science Corporation, a large defense
contractor, pulling down a salary in the mid-forties.
He was married and lived in a townhouse, and four
months ago his wife had given birth to a baby boy. And so,
when Lowry was cruising the Internet from work and
spotted a notice announcing White Rabbit Toys, he favored
it with a virtual visit. He ordered a colorful toy top
for $13, the Floor Spinner from Primetime Playthings.</p>

<p class='c018'>Many people on the Web were young males more interested
in pizza or condoms than in baby toys, but the
Lilienfelds were looking ahead a few years when the same
Net people would be parents. “It’s an act of faith,” Bob
Lilienfeld said. “Today’s demographics and selling a lot of
toys on the Net may be out of synch. But today’s college students
are tomorrow’s parents. Tomorrow’s parents aren’t
going to consider ordering by computer any different from
getting in a car and going to the shopping center.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Other trends might work in the Lilienfelds’ favor.
More and more Americans were time-short, with long
commutes; Stuart Lowry himself spent forty-five minutes
each way, and that actually was a quick trip compared to
those in cities such as Los Angeles. In northern Virginia I
knew of parents rising at 4 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> to go to jobs in Washington
some forty miles away, and not a few of them were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>high-tech workers who would sooner or later end up on
the Internet.</p>

<p class='c018'>When I reached Bob and Jo Ann Lilienfeld in the middle
of November, White Rabbit itself had been on the Net
maybe a week and had enjoyed around 1,000 virtual visits
in that time. They were hoping that these numbers would
multiply as Christmas neared. It was too soon to tell how
many of these people would actually order. Back in June,
though, the Lilienfelds had grown excited after reading
about Larry Grant in the <cite>New York Times</cite> and elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I saw this figure of 20 million Net users,” Jo Ann said
of the numbers du jour, “and thought there’s definitely an
opportunity here. But I didn’t want to go about it in a half-baked
manner. I thought there had to be someone who
could combine knowledge of the Net with marketing experience.”
She checked out a local cybermall and found it
wanting in the latter area.</p>

<p class='c018'>That wasn’t surprising, given Jo Ann’s perfectionism
and eagerness to avoid easy but far-from-satisfactory solutions—whether
in retail or life in general. She had
grown up in a cash-short household where, more often
than not, the children would get out the oatmeal cartons
and construction paper and scissors and cobble together
their own toys. And the same creativity had carried over to
her Bloomies days as one of the resident experts on
Christmas tree trimmings. According to the Lilienfelds, it
was JoAnn who came up with the idea of selling leafless,
white branches. She and Bob had moved to Ann Arbor because
he kept flying off to the Midwest to consult for
clients in Midland, and they felt that married people
needed to spend more time together. JoAnn went about
establishing the White Rabbit just as conscientiously.</p>

<p class='c018'>Not finding the right toys for her own children, she
studied the demographics of Ann Arbor to verify that a toy
store could thrive there. She concluded that in a university
community, many would love those wooden train sets and
other classic toys as opposed to the trendier offerings that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>were touted on television and sold at Toys <span class='large'>ᴙ</span> Us. Ann Arbor
responded well. A local paper told how she blessed her
store with a public bathroom—how she kept diapers and
spare wipes around for the parents of children and emergencies.
No need for toilets existed on the Internet. But
even at this early stage, having read up on the Netfolks, she
was attuned to the need to adapt to the culture of cyberspace.</p>

<p class='c018'>JoAnn finally decided that her best savior, the requisite
miracle-worker with both Net and marketing experience,
lived right there in the Lilienfeld household. Those
past few months her husband had been succeeding off a
mix of garbage and the Internet.</p>

<p class='c018'>To be exact, Bob Lilienfeld was advising clients about
<em>future</em> garbage, the packing materials for consumer products,
a major contributor to landfills. He hadn’t anything
against recycling. But thanks to his work at Procter &amp;
Gamble, he had concluded that the best way to cope with
waste was to design packages to avoid it in the first place.
Manufacturers and customers alike would win. Bob
would go on to help put together a network of likeminded
consultants, including William Rathje, a world-famous
garbage expert at the University of Arizona who
had co-authored <cite>Rubbish! The Archaeology of Garbage</cite>.
Lilienfeld met Rathje at a press conference but also found
himself relying on another source of contacts, the
Internet. Again and again he had heard about the Net
from professors at the University of Michigan, and he
soon was in touch with other garbage mavens around the
planet.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I started sucking in information,” he recalled. “I
found out about mailing lists and newsgroups, and then I
decided I would put my newsletter up on the Net and see
what happened.” The newsletter was a way to let clients
know about his consulting company, the Cygnus Group. It
helped Fortune 500 companies, other businesses, trade
associations, educational groups, and others grow more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>sensitive to environmental concerns in activities ranging
from packaging to marketing.</p>

<p class='c018'>Just as JoAnn was careful to befriend Ann Arbor in the
right way, Bob tried to honor the conventions of the Net—avoiding
hucksterism in favor of helpful information. The
announcements about the newsletter were low-key, and
response was good. Soon he was sharing his articles with
hundreds of Netfolks who asked such questions as: “I recently
saw an article on compact fluorescent light bulbs in
<cite>Consumer Reports</cite>. Why aren’t more stores and utilities
selling them?”</p>

<p class='c018'>An “Ask Bill and Bob” column, cowritten with William
Rathje, revealed that such lights “take at least eight times
more energy to produce than old-fashioned bulbs. And
they’re heavier, so they use more energy during shipping.”
The column also told of an experiment that McDonald’s
was conducting in Albany, New York, with food and paper
composting, saving perhaps 500-700 pounds per week of
solid waste. Readers could learn, too, that a nut seller was
moving from glass and plastic bottles to vacuum bags.</p>

<p class='c018'>Bob Lilienfeld was hardly an eco-activist by the standards
of, say, Greenpeace; Dow Chemical was among his
prime clients, after all. But he was serving up information
for people with many different viewpoints, and by way of
the proper clicks with your mouse, you could travel from
his Web site to areas of the Internet such as the Envirolink
Network, or EcoGopher, or EcoNet.</p>

<p class='c018'>His newsletter, known as <cite>The ULS Report</cite> (short for
“use less stuff”), carried an item about CD-ROM disks. It
described them as “an environmentally friendly way to
reduce waste and save resources. One CD-ROM, including
packaging, weighs under half a pound. The 22 books
that it replaces weigh 70 pounds.” Knowingly or not, he
was helping to pave the way for the virtual White
Rabbit—where the same principles applied. Via the
Internet, White Rabbit could advertise to thousands without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>printing up catalogues for them. Oh, they might request
catalogues later, but then they would have prequalified
themselves, reducing the solid waste. Lewis Carroll
would have approved of the reasoning here. What’s more,
unlike paper catalogues, Lilienfeld could update his electronic
catalogue to change prices or play up the fastest-selling
merchandise.</p>

<p class='c018'>The World Wide Web was the main way to put White
Rabbit on the Internet. Once merchants on the Net would
have favored a service called Gopher (as in “go-fer-it”) in
honor of the mascot at the University of Minnesota.
Gopher displayed text very well and needed less bandwidth
on the Net than the Web did. But it lacked the
pizzazz of the Web-Mosaic combination; that is, the ability
to conjure up pictures and even sound so easily.
Although Bob used Gopher for digging up scholarly works
about the environment, it was like black-and-white television
while Web-Mosaic was color and all the more alluring
for commercial purposes.</p>

<p class='c018'>Getting White Rabbit on the Web was surprisingly
cheap in some ways. The Lilienfelds’ network provider
charged JoAnn just $50 a month, plus $2 an hour for
when she was using electronic mail or handling other
chores. That didn’t include Bob’s time, however. He knew
at least the basics of the necessary programming language
and didn’t require the services of a consultant to the
extent that others might have.</p>

<p class='c018'>Net.business, 3D-Style</p>

</div>
<p class='c024'>You can’t <em>touch</em> merchandise on the World Wide
Web. But the next best thing may be in store.</p>

<p class='c018'>Virtual reality will let you “walk” through Web
businesses and see merchandise in greater detail as
you get “closer” to the object on your screen. You can
vary the angles, too. So you could use your mouse to
tour a parking lot of automobiles. You could spot the
Volvo or the Saturn of your dreams, and admire not
only the outside but also the interior.</p>

<p class='c018'>No, the Web will never replace actual shopping
in most cases, but virtual reality will be increasingly
good at helping you screen preliminary choices.</p>

<p class='c018'>Keep an eye out, then, for WebSpace—the new
3D viewer from Silicon Graphics, the California
company whose technology helped create many of
the special effects in <cite>Jurassic Park</cite>. WebSpace will
work as an add-on with popular Web browsers such
as Netscape and Spyglass Enhanced Mosaic.</p>

<p class='c018'>WebSpace-style technology, needless to say, is
far too good to waste on shopping alone. Virtual reality
software for the Web may also help you tour
the National Gallery of Art, the Library of Congress,
or Mount Kilimanjaro—not to mention Hong Kong
or Rio de Janeiro.</p>

<p class='c018'>3D technology could revolutionize the financial
world. Small investors, not just high-powered stock
analysts, could “see” stock market trends. Your
screen might display a “Bulls’ Corner” with a collection
of corporate logos color-coded according to the
improvement in the stock price. You could open up
the logos and go on a tour of various divisions, wandering
around them electronically with far more
ease than you could with less advanced software.</p>

<p class='c018'>Similarly, at the suggestion of your broker, you
could tour a Bear’s Corner and see why you might
avoid or sell off certain shares.</p>

<p class='c018'>Mind you, there are negatives. Corporations—whether
stores selling merchandise or companies
seeking investors—may use this slick technology to
fool the public. On the other hand, the Internet is already
a godsend for consumers and small investors.
Via Usenet newsgroups and mailing lists, they can
swap information, taking care of course to look for
plants from companies trying to sway grassroots
impressions.</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>Lilienfeld himself put in most of the set-up hours. It
took him a few days of programming to design the Web site
and scan in the pictures of more than two dozen items—the
train sets, the puzzles, the tops, the blocks—and like an
old-fashioned art director he had to create within the limits
of the medium. The big problem was photos. If they
were too big to move over the Net quickly, then the peeved
readers might give up and go on to another Web site. If too
small, however, the pictures would lack enough detail to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>show off the store or the merchandise. In many cases Bob
would let readers click on pictures of bears to see larger
versions of the photos.</p>

<p class='c018'>He also had to worry about the software the readers
used on the Internet—certain Mosaic-style browsers
would show <em>smaller</em> objects first. Other challenges arose.
What if technical standards changed so that only certain
browsers would work with Bob’s site? The real White
Rabbit might be a victim of acts of God such as the ebb
and flow of automobile traffic, and the virtual Rabbit
needed to worry about patterns of Net traffic, but it also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>could be subject to Jehovah in the form of macho software
firms who wanted everyone on the Net to use their
brainchildren.</p>

<p class='c018'>Companies such as Netscape Communications Corporation
actually gave away Mosaic-style products to us
Netfolk for free, hoping to make fortunes instead off the
software that merchants and others denizens on the Web
would run. Netscape was the champ in late 1994, the one
that let you go from page to page faster than any competitor
did. Many people feared Netscape would be to the Web
what Microsoft was to software; suppose Netscape used
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>technical prowess and marketing skill to trample competitors,
and maybe overcharge the customers.</p>

<p class='c018'>A green monster named Mozilla came up on one of
Netscape’s welcoming screens, and pessimists wondered
if the company itself might someday play the part. Marc
Andreessen, the top software designer at Netscape, had
led the team that came up with the original Mosaic at the
University of Illinois. And then he had left Illinois to join a
new company that, from the ground up, had designed the
speedier Netscape product. The Web community mightily
hoped that Mozilla and keepers would behave themselves.
Suppose that Netscape joined Microsoft or credit card
companies to build in special, billing-related features that
users of other browsers couldn’t use?</p>

<p class='c018'>Netscape, however, seemed benign so far, and the
browser’s technical <a id='corr44.16'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='wizardry,'>wizardry</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_44.16'><ins class='correction' title='wizardry,'>wizardry</ins></a></span> was winning many friends.
With a click of the mouse, for example, you could scoot
smoothly from the Web to the usual newsgroups, and Bob
Lilienfeld took advantage of this. He set up his computer
system so that customers with the proper software could
whiz directly from White Rabbit to child-related newsgroups.</p>

<p class='c018'>One moment you could be shopping for toys; the next,
exchanging tips with a New Zealander or Norwegian on
how to cope with tantrum-prone babies. You could zip to
misc.kids (“A great place to swap parenting war stories”),
misc.kids.consumers (“Help with purchasing decisions”),
or misc.kids.computer (“Enough said!”). Or you or your
children could read odds and ends about wombats, Forester
kangaroos, Tasmanian devils, fish, lions, dinosaurs, and
other creatures at WombatNet; print out drawings of the
human heart or the stars or hear a thunderbolt by way of
the Franklin Institute Virtual Science Museum; and learn
the population of Uganda or Afghanistan via <cite>The CIA
World Factbook</cite>, a guide assembled by the real-life Central
Intelligence Agency.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>Fighting the companies such as AT&amp;T and the big
cable interests, many activists likened the Internet to a series
of communities with opportunities for small merchants
and citizen-to-citizen communications as opposed
to couch potato offerings from the Fortune 500. Merchants
such as the Lilienfelds were acting out the very models
about which the activists waxed so enthusiastically.</p>

<p class='c018'>Bob Lilienfeld understood that just as storekeepers in
a small town would do well to join the Kiwanis Club, virtual
storefronts should be part of Net life. JoAnn would
soon go to a toy convention, and at some point, she might
well share her impressions with the denizens of misc.kids
and similar newsgroups, as opposed simply to touting her
products. At the same time, yes, by way of a signature at
the bottom of her posts, people on the Net could find out
about the toy store. She might even start a mailing list for
the receptive. Bob had already shown the success of this
model by way of the list and other tools used to promote
his consulting activities.</p>

<p class='c018'>A toy-oriented list could be much more than ads.
“Going shopping isn’t just spending money,” Lilienfeld
observed, “<a id='corr45.22'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='its'>it’s</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_45.22'><ins class='correction' title='its'>it’s</ins></a></span> a social phenomenon. It’s seeing people you
know, it’s being part of a crowd.” And it’s also picking up
gossip and maybe even solid information. “Ultimately the
toy store will be bigger than just a toy store,” he said. “We
might be providing information on child development, of
the appropriateness of certain toys or coloring books. If
you’re a model train hobbyist, we might be able to help
you hook up with model train users groups.”</p>

<p class='c018'>In fact, by way of the mouse-activated links from
White Rabbit to newsgroups and other Web sites, he was
already offering much more than just a store. The line between
merchants and information providers was blurring
in the case of Bob and JoAnn; the higher the quality of the
information at White Rabbit, the more it would be a virtual
gathering place for people on the World Wide Web. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>wasn’t surprised to hear some people say that librarians
might be the star sales reps of the future. It wasn’t hype.
Information, not just prices and selection of merchandise,
would be what drew Netfolks to sites such as the
Lilienfeldss’ . Of course Bob Lilienfeld might want to be
choosy about what links he listed. If he listed too many of
the mediocre ones, then he would simply be replicating
the function of the powerful search programs on the Web
and adding to people’s “information overload,” to use an
ever-popular phrase.</p>

<p class='c018'>Software already let sophisticated Netfolks zero in on
items of interest. Merely by typing in the word “toys,” for
example, I could find scads of listings—from mentions of
adult sex toys to the Web site advertising the gun that
fired Ping-Pong balls. And these programs would soon be
simple enough for even technoklutzes to use. So the
Lilienfelds had better offer something that the software
could not supply: Their judgments about which Web
sites, newsgroups, and mailing lists were the most fun or
most informative.</p>

<p class='c018'>All through the Christmas season, JoAnn kept refining
her Net-related plans. “We need to ask, ‘Have we chosen
the right items?’” she said. “The draw of our toy store is,
it’s an exciting place to shop. We have to do the same on
the Internet. If we add more items, it will approach a catalogue
more. Right now our competition is mail-order catalogues,
and we have a lot of items that they’re not
offering. Maybe we’ll be reaching people not on the traditional
catalogue list. They could be more occasional toy
buyers than frequent toy buyers.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Thanks to a computerized inventory system, JoAnn’s
corporeal store carried more than 6,500 items. Bob made
a mental note: He might want to put more of them on the
Net so customers would enjoy a wider selection. JoAnn
talked about her suppliers: “My goal was really getting
this up and going for Christmas. When I get to the toy fair
I’ll discuss this with the national sales managers and see
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>if I can’t get discounts for advertising to so many people,
and then we’re working probably toward next Christmas.
We’ll be working toward fourth quarter of ’95.”</p>

<p class='c018'>That was a healthy attitude. Even toward the end of
the season the number of visits didn’t go past 2,000 a
week, and only a handful of actual sales resulted. The
only customers were Luciana Gores; Stuart Lowry, the
computer jock turned family man; Michael Wolfe, a West
Virginia professor studying Internet commerce, who ordered
half a dozen stuffed toy caterpillars; a second academic,
in the Midwest, who bought a Ravensburger
Snail’s Pace Race game; a Massachusetts woman sending
three customizable dolls to her sister (“I’m testing business
on the Net—aren’t you lucky?”); and David Fry, the
operator of a cybermall nearby who was curious about
the White Rabbit, and who bought First Blocks.</p>

<p class='c018'>Not that the Lilienfelds had completely wasted their
time. As of Christmas, a <cite>Wall Street Journal</cite> story hadn’t appeared,
but the Detroit paper and others had gone ahead
with articles, and customers poured onto the floor of the
real White Rabbit, one even buying the giant polar bear
that Bob had been hoping to give his nine-year-old son.
The publicity may have brought in some $20,000-$25,000
in extra sales by Bob’s estimates, on which the Lilienfelds
may have netted around $2,000—compared to $750 gross
and $75 net from Net orders. Bob told me that other merchants
on the Web were also reporting a low number of
sales. The week before Christmas the number of visits to
White Rabbit itself actually declined; many of the prospective
customers had been logging on from school or work,
and now they had partly emptied the Web along with their
dorm rooms and offices.</p>

<p class='c018'>From a get-rich-quick perspective, then, the virtual
White Rabbit had been a zero. Bob and JoAnn were smart
marketers with MBAs from a Big Ten business school,
and he had a real feel for the Internet, which he had successfully
used to expand his consulting business. But even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>the Lilienfelds could not score right away. Oh, how tantalizing
the gargantuan numbers had been—the tens of millions
of users said to exist; the million by which the Net
was supposed to be growing each month. And yet in the
end, when the time came for customers to key in the
credit card numbers, the market had vanished like the
Cheshire cat. That didn’t mean the Lilienfelds were foolish;
just a week or two after Christmas, a wonderful twist
happened. The number of visits to the toy store fell off. But
sales leapt up. By mid-January White Rabbit was moving
an average of a toy a day—not a Kmart volume, but an improvement.
Bob explained the difference. Now White
Rabbit’s first screen told customers that the store could
often get toys not mentioned online.</p>

<p class='c018'>Encouraged, Lilienfeld added yet another improvement,
an 800 number. Now customers could ask their
questions the old-fashioned way if they preferred, and
they could also order by voice if they didn’t trust the Net
with their credit card numbers.</p>

<p class='c018'>With enough tweaks like this, the virtual toy store
might eventually flourish as the number of Web users
grew. Just like the characters in many children’s stories,
the White Rabbit would keep on changing—adding ever-more-intriguing
links to newsgroups and other Web sites,
putting in the software to help novice toy shoppers choose
just the right ball or train set, figuring out new ways to use
the interplay between the Net and the traditional media.
Sooner or later, the Netheads would reproduce, and when
they went looking for rattles and Lego sets, Bob and
JoAnn would be ready for them. The story of White Rabbit
Toys, like that of the Internet itself, was far from over.</p>
<div class='textbox1 width75'>

<p class='c024'>The Electronic Billboard: Grant’s Flowers</p>

</div>
<p class='c024'>Larry Grant just might be doing better at the moment
than the Lilienfelds were. He was selling flowers, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>what better merchandise existed for grad students who
were alone at the keyboard in a dark office at two o’clock,
and who had forgotten their girlfriends’ birthdays?</p>

<p class='c018'>A newsletter publisher named Rosalind Resnick—a
former staff reporter for the <cite>Miami Herald</cite> and the author
of an Internet business guide—was grossing more than
$20,000 a year in subscriptions and expecting to do much
better in 1995.<a id='r2.4' /><a href='#f2.4' class='c022'><sup>[2.4]</sup></a> And her media-oriented newsletter helped
pave the way for a lucrative consulting business. I also
knew of a network expert named Gordon Cook who was
able to jet to a three-week research expedition in Moscow
at his own expense, and who lived satisfactorily on the
revenue from <cite>The Cook Report on Internet</cite> and related activities.<a id='r2.5' /><a href='#f2.5' class='c022'><sup>[2.5]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c018'>Grant’s Flowers, however, was more of a typical business.
Larry Grant wasn’t a writer. And his work was not as
network-related as that of Resnick and Cook; unlike the
latter, he hadn’t evolved into a net.personality on some
key mailing lists. Instead the word was that Larry Grant
just paid his $28 a month to an electronic mall—a collection
of stores that shared a common subarea of the Net—and
sat back and watched his fax machine spew out
orders. Grant might not be Davy Crockett in terms of action,
but certainly in terms of fame he was coming along.
He had appeared as a success story, after all, on the front
page of the <cite>New York Times</cite> business section.</p>

<p class='c018'>As I wended my way through the Net to Grant’s
Flowers, I passed through an area called Branch Mall. A
logo with a tree branch greeted me. I saw listings for enterprises
ranging from cosmetic sellers to H &amp; H Logging
and Timber Company. Under “Flowers, Gifts, Foods,” I
didn’t see just Grant’s listing. I saw White Dove Flower
and Gift Shop, Flowers on Lexington, Exotic Flowers of
Hawaii, Bonsai Boy of New York, and half a dozen others.
Bob Lilienfeld was skeptical about cybermalls, and right
now I could see why. With all this competition, could
Grant’s make money off the Internet?</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>Lilienfeld had reminded me that traditional malls and
the cyber variety were different, and I understood. If I
wanted to shop for books, I could brave traffic to reach
Springfield Mall, a large collection of shops maybe ten
miles from me in the suburbs of Washington, D.C.
Springfield would be worth the drive. I could visit four
stores right within a five-minute walk of each other—Brentano’s,
B. Dalton, Walden, and Crown.</p>

<p class='c018'>The Net, however, was also different. I didn’t have to
drive anywhere. I could just use a powerful search engine
such as Lycos, key in “bookstore,” and watch name after
name pop up on my screen. Lycos demanded just a little
technical savvy. But easier alternatives would come along.
As if that weren’t enough, Netfolks put together lists of activities
on the Internet, and often they included commercial
categories. I’d found White Rabbit not through
advertising but through the Yahoo list out of Stanford
University, on the other side of North America. Distance
just didn’t matter. So could the shopping mall metaphor
truly work out to the benefit of merchants such as Larry
Grant?</p>

<p class='c018'>Branch Mall at the very least had set Grant up in style.
The opening screen was attractive and helpful to buyers,
with such basics as: “Different areas of the country sometimes
have different prices or may be unable to supply certain
flowers. For example, New York City has high rents and
costs of doing business, so flowers are more expensive
there....” And then below I saw a list of the offerings—for
example, “One dozen boxed long stem roses. A fragrant
classic. $49.95 to $99.95.” In the virtual version of the White
Rabbit toy store you couldn’t rattle the toys, and in Branch
Mall you couldn’t smell the roses, but like the Lilienfelds,
Branch Mall had been generous with pictures of the merchandise.
I loved some little touches. Branch had given
Grant a reminder service into which you could key your
spouse’s birthday or some other date, before which an
e-mail note would be sent to jog you to do your duty.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>The selection was varied. You could order everything
from the roses to “a get well soup cup containing button
mums, daisies, mini carnations, standard carnations,
monte casino, statice, and a package of chicken soup.
$26.” All in all, I felt that this area was even better laid out
than White Rabbit Toys, where the opening page, though
far, far above average, didn’t communicate quite as much
information as I’d have liked. As with White Rabbit, you
could order online by filling out an electronic form.</p>

<p class='c018'>Missing from the virtual version of Grant’s flower
shop, however, were the customized links that helped give
the White Rabbit Toys its personality and made it a true
part of the Net. If Larry Grant had been as at home in cyberspace
as Rob Lilienfeld was, he could have added links
to love-oriented discussion areas or to poetry—perhaps
even the Shakespearean variety.</p>

<p class='c018'>But instead this Web page was serving just as an electronic
billboard with an ordering mechanism. I didn’t
even see a photograph of the store. When the <cite>New York
Times</cite> published a photo of a Mosaic screen, it had superimposed
a picture of Grant amid his flowers and dressed
in an apron with an FTD insignia. Couldn’t a similar
photo have adorned his Web area?</p>

<p class='c018'>For that matter, the store didn’t even offer an electronic
mail address, just a phone number for customers
with questions. This isn’t to criticize Larry Grant. He was
not an honorary techie as Bob Lilienfeld was. Like
Lilienfeld, however, Grant was an intelligent, diligent
Midwest businessman who saw the Net as an opportunity.</p>

<p class='c018'>Wild talk <em>about</em> Grant notwithstanding, he wasn’t a
braggart—simply a proud family entrepreneur. I learned
that Grant’s Flowers was actually part of a mini local conglomerate.
“We’ve been here since 1947,” he said, “and my
folks started farming and selling produce by the side of
the road off a kitchen table. We’re now a million-dollar
business and have many facets. We have a flower and gift
shop, and the front of the building is beer and foods. We
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>farm 131 acres.” Two brothers were in the business, and
so was his eighty-year-old mother. “She runs the flower
and gift section, and I run the rest of the retail sales and
my brothers do all the growing and production. We’ve got
two acres of greenhouses growing plants for spring sale or
gardeners. It’s a very diversified operation.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Grant clearly wasn’t making a living off the Internet
alone, despite a good start. “We got online in February just
before Valentine’s Day and we received forty orders that
week. In the first ten days we had over 2,900 look in on
our electronic storefront. Then it dropped to one or two
orders a day, and then we got to Mother’s Day and had a
high of forty in one day. Currently we’ve increased from
one or two to six, in that range.”</p>

<p class='c018'>When I asked what his current Net-related gross
would be per year, he roughly estimated it at perhaps
$15,000 or $20,000. That was enough to make the Web
area well worth his time, but this was hardly a tale of instant
riches. I remembered a magazine ad—for would-be
providers of Internet services—that showed a mustached
man beside a Rolls or Mercedes. Larry Grant was a Web
merchant, not someone hooking people up with the Net.
But I wished that the get-rich-quickers of all stripes could
see Larry Grant as a realistic example of the Net’s
promise. The gold might come eventually, and it was
worthwhile to chase after it by going online, but, for most
people, the big money wasn’t there yet.</p>

<p class='c018'>What’s more, costs for newer customers of Branch
Mall were higher. Grant had been the first merchant there
and enjoyed a break. Now Branch was charging thousands
a year for Web areas that included elaborate programming
and creative work.<a id='r2.6' /><a href='#f2.6' class='c022'><sup>[2.6]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c018'>Larry Grant, in any event, believed in the Net and in
the Mall itself. His virtual operation wasn’t costing him
<em>that</em> much, and I suspected that even with somewhat
higher expenses, other tenants might do fine in the end if
they were in the right business. “Number one,” Grant said,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>“we don’t have to take and buy more inventory. Number
two, we don’t have to have a bigger facility. And number
three, we don’t need a sales staff. We can do with the staff
we have in handling these orders. It’s a neat way to find
new business. I don’t have to handle any of the products directly.
The customer does all the ordering through the
company in his area and it’s shipped from the company to
them, and I get my commission check at the end of the
month.” He liked the concept so much that he started a
Fuller Brush franchise on the Net. The same key principles
applied: No inventory to worry about and no sales staff,
just some dealings with Branch and orders emerging from
a fax machine.</p>

<p class='c018'>Merchants like Bob Lilienfeld might fare well without
a cybermall involved—they knew how to spread word
about themselves on the Net by way of newsgroups and
mailing lists—but I could also see the possibilities for people
such as Larry Grant as long as they kept their expectations
to a reasonable level. Grant himself didn’t view the
other flower shops at Branch Mall as direct competitors; he
depicted himself as more of a general florist than the others,
what with their specialties in Hawaiian flowers and the
like. Certainly a good cybermall, like the brick-and-concrete
version, needed a good tenant mix—with a toy store
not appearing on the same screen as, say, a <em>sex</em> toy shop.</p>

<p class='c018'>If that right mix wasn’t around, why have the mall in
the first place? While it was true that the Net shrank distances,
it did take time to move from screen to screen at
typical modem speeds. And yet, reflecting, I could indeed
see a future for malls. Even when search engines were
easier to use, people might still not avail themselves of
them—preferring to browse instead. So the mall concept
might well endure to the advantage of people like Larry
Grant.</p>

<p class='c018'>All kinds of people itched for their percentages of the
cybermall business. Jon Zeeff, the mall operator who had
set up Larry Grant with his electronic billboard, had once
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>written medical software. David Fry was a Harvard Ph.D.
in computer science, came from a family in the printing
business, and ran an offshoot called Fry Multimedia. Ann
Arbor wasn’t Silicon Valley, but just in that one university
town, at least three local business people were on the Web
in a serious way, if you included Bob Lilienfeld. Like him,
Fry wisely thought in the long term. Drumming up business
from well-known brands such as Ragu spaghetti
sauce, he did not promise an instant audience in the millions.
He urged companies to go on the Web, experiment
with interactive advertising, and make their mistakes <em>before</em>
the Net became a truly mass medium for Madison
Avenue.</p>

<p class='c018'>Some get-rich-quickers, of course, also were jostling
for virtual tenants; even Canter and Siegel showed up by
way of an area called Cybersell, and I enjoyed the irony.
C &amp; S had carpet bombed thousands of newsgroups with
the same message—while encouraging other merchants
to ignore conventional Netiquette—and yet now they were
also relying on the more focused approach of a Web area.</p>

<p class='c018'>Phone companies, too, wanted to run malls on the
World Wide Web. And that created problems for some.
While the Net might use their phone lines, many of these
corporations felt out of place in an anarchistic environment
over which they had far less than the accustomed
amount of control. In the mall business they would be
competing against nimble entrepreneurs like Zeeff and
Fry. Still, phone companies could take advantage of their
existing networks to one extent or another, and if the
Yellow Pages were going online in a new incarnation,
then the Baby Bells and AT&amp;T wanted their share of the
business. Of all the mall-related efforts in early 1995, the
most ambitious may have been from a phone company,
MCI. It exemplified—as I soon discovered in the most direct
of ways—both the best and the worst of Big Business
on the Web.</p>

<p class='c024'>MCI and the Internet had A History. The Net used
phone lines from many companies, but MCI had long
been one of the major players here; some 40 percent of the
Internet traffic in the United States passed over its cables,
and nowadays the senior vice-president of data architecture
was none other than Vint Cerf. As much as anyone he
was Mr. Net, one of the founding fathers. MCI also employed
the head of a standard-setting body called the
Internet Engineering Task Force. Unsurprisingly, MCI
marketers were coming out with statements in the vein of:
<em>When you think Internet, we want you to think of us.</em></p>

<p class='c018'>I asked a product manager how much of the Net-related
commerce he could envision involving an electronic
marketplace from MCI. Well, he said, MCI had
around one-fifth of the long-distance business in the
U.S.—and why not the same share on the Internet?</p>

<p class='c018'>Clearly, however, if MCI wanted to woo the Larry
Grants of this world, it faced a major marketing problem.
Just like Jon Zeeff, it would have to sell business people
on the Net as a vehicle for their messages; and that meant
<em>lots</em> of education, not just hype. MCI, moreover, was offering
a range of services far, far broader than Zeeff’s. In an
MCI-perfect world, you would advertise your business by
way of marketplaceMCI. Prospective customers on the Net
could browse through a giant online directory and follow
a link to your electronic storefront. MCI would cleverly
lure them to its area. People would be able to retrieve
voice phone numbers in far-off cities and enjoy other information
services for free.</p>

<p class='c018'>On MCI’s planet, you’d of course use internetMCI for
your electronic mail and your Web browsing. You also
could hold video conferences during which people saw not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>only each other but the same contract or spreadsheet,
which they could jointly modify even if they were thousands
of miles apart. You could even receive updates on
your pet news topic by way of MCI—just the ticket for keeping
up with competitors or with a favorite athletic team.</p>

<p class='c018'>Not all of MCI’s new services related to the Internet.
But like marketplaceMCI, many did. And even with 30
million people hooked in by way of e-mail if nothing else,
public ignorance was massive. Larry Magid, a computer
columnist, observed that even a single TV show such as
<cite>Home Improvement</cite> could attract greater numbers. If MCI
wanted to enjoy volume befitting a phone company, then,
it had better prepare for some major evangelizing—about
both the Net and non-Net services. MCI tried the broadcast
model in the most traditional of ways. Splashy commercials
aired on national television. They starred a fictitious
publishing company, Gramercy Press, whose president,
Peter Hoffman, had a <em>big</em> crush on MCI. Whether the service
was video conferencing or electronic mail, Hoffman
was itching to open his wallet for it.</p>

<p class='c018'>Darlene Davis was the character with the most air
time, the hip young receptionist who was waging a valiant
battle to get Martin Banks, the resident technophobe, online.
If this portly old crank of an editor wanted to read the
latest memos from Darlene, then he had better plug in his
computer. Curtiss Bruno was the sales manager with his
heart on his quotas and Darlene. MCI’s electronic services
could allow him to achieve at least the former goal.
Nowadays Darlene happily used e-mail to help stay out of
flirting distance with him. Ellen deRosset was the resident
intellectual snob and a Net browser. Reginald Gales used
MCI’s news feature to keep Martin up on cricket scores.
Marta Dragelov was an info junky in keeping with her duties
as a fact checker.</p>

<p class='c018'>In a country where fantasy and reality often turned
into one big mush, where O. J. Simpson movies could go
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>into production before the end of the murder trial, where
legions of commercials aped news programs, where the
Speaker of the House would soon be hosting a cable TV
showing of <cite>Boys Town</cite> after having touted orphanages as a
major solution to the welfare problem—in a nation like
this, it was as inevitable as a $1 million book deal for O.J.
that the mythical Darlene would draw job offers and marriage
proposals from people wanting to be part of the fun.</p>

<p class='c018'>“These were breakout and breakaway characters that
took on a life of their own,” said Mark Pettit, the MCI public
relations man who was handling Gramercy matters.
What’s more, the company’s advertising agency, MVBMS,
hadn’t just tried to make Gramercy real in the real world;
the agency people had also made the characters real in the
<em>video</em> world by way of an introductory commercial that
looked like a preview of a new fall series.</p>

<p class='c018'>Having conquered TV, then, and with the Internet a
main focus of the ad campaign, how could MCI <em>not</em> have
opened up a Web area to ballyhoo the same services that
Darlene was pushing on the tube? The commercials had
whetted interest in the characters. And now MCI would
see if it could satisfy this curiosity while also passing on
more details about its new line of services. “People
wanted more than thirty seconds of information,” Pettit
said, “and it can be hard to give them more on TV. What if
we turned this into a real place that they could go visit?
And that’s how it came to life.” By MCI’s own estimate,
more than a million people visited the “real place” in the
first six weeks or so. Even Bob Lilienfeld dropped by. He
was an MCI stockholder and wanted to keep an open
mind despite his skepticism about the mall concept—maybe
he could do business with pros like MCI’s.
Lilienfeld filled out a form that offered a two-month trial
of Net-related services, and waited.</p>

<p class='c018'>I first visited the Gramercy Press around the same time
that Lilienfeld did. The site popped up on my screen with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>color photos of a perky-looking Darlene and friends. I saw a
red logo, too. A small “GP” appeared between “Gramercy”
and “Press,” a nice little touch that a real publisher might
have tried. I wondered what ambitions MCI had. Might it
turn the fictitious GP into a commercial publisher someday?
The screen said Gramercy was “The World’s First
Virtual Publishing House,” and across the top I saw color
photos of Darlene and friends, all looking as real as ever. If
I’d been impatient for a hard sell, I could have clicked immediately
on items such as “networkBusiness” or “MCI
Telecommunications, Inc.”</p>

<p class='c018'>But like the rest of the cosmos, I was more keen on
reading some virtual gossip from virtual humans. In a
primitive way, reminiscent of many a best-seller, a teaser
led me on. I learned that the people of Gramercy were
“working on secret projects, curt memos, random
thoughts, Machiavellian power plays,” and that I might
“even browse a clandestine love letter or two about to be
sent via e-mail across the corridor.”</p>

<p class='c018'>So I clicked, with much anticipation, on “Gramercy
Press.” Against a dark, purplish-blue sky I saw a semiornate,
low-rise office building, the same one featured in
the TV commercial. Not to leave anything to chance, a
caption told me about tweeds and patches and old pipes
<em>and</em> the fact that “every one—from the receptionist to the
president himself—is online via networkMCI Business.”
Despite the clichés such as the stereotypical reference to
tweeds, this site was clearly showing far more imagination
than the usual WWW area did.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Now,” the screen told me, “click on any window and
you’ll start to get a feel of the inside workings of a major
New York publishing concern.”</p>

<p class='c018'>I chose a pane on the top floor and saw Darlene near
her keyboard, smiling away and looking as if I’d caught her
in the middle of an intense gossip session. The screen suggested
that I click for audio. I did and downloaded a short
snippet. “I love technology,” she said in a high-pitched,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>girlish voice, and giggled a little nervously as if to tell the
world, “Hey, I’m a real person, not an actress taping an ad.”</p>

<p class='c018'>The text on the screen was credibly self-promotional:
“I’m a combination of a staff psychiatrist, gopher, organizer,
coffee maker, ruffled-feather soother, astrologer, party organizer,
invitation sender, flower orderer, delivered-lunch
acceptor, and philosopher. Oh yes, I also disseminate messages.
A job made infinitely easier thanks to e-mailMCI. I
threw out those little pink message pads. e-mailMCI is so
much more efficient. I just click on my computer and the
message gets to the right person instantly. Whether they
call back is up to them. Hey, I can’t be their conscience,
mother, and etiquette professor too. I wear enough hats.
And I have many aptitudes. For instance, I was college skiing
champ. You didn’t know that about me. Nor did you
know I have a master’s degree in medieval literature. Or
that Ellen deRosset is going to need an editorial assistant.
Of course, she doesn’t know it yet either.”</p>

<p class='c018'>I moved on to Darlene’s e-mail by clicking on, yes, her
monitor. And suddenly I was getting another pitch from
MCI in the cleverest of ways—I saw a screen shot of a
menu from e-mailMCI, complete with such commands as
“Compose,” “Forward,” and “Reply.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Beneath the menu appeared a message list:</p>
<table class='table1' summary=''>
<colgroup>
<col width='40%' />
<col width='60%' />
</colgroup>
  <tr>
    <td class='c015'>E. deRosset</td>
    <td class='c029'>Short Story Submissions</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c015'>C. Bruno</td>
    <td class='c029'>Excellent Proposition</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c015'>R. Gales</td>
    <td class='c029'>Cover Art Submissions</td>
  </tr>

    <td class='c029'>Interesting Facts</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c015'>P. Hoffman</td>
    <td class='c029'>Free at Last</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p class='c024'>I opened the e-mail. Ellen deRosset was complaining
that “My office has more manuscripts than the Library of
Alexandria—I’m running out of room for me. Could people
submit their stories over the Internet instead of
through the mail?” Reginald Gales wrote that he’d sent
out a fax to computer artists, asking for submissions; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>in fact MCI was offering to post the works of electronic
artists, not just writers. Under the subject line “Excellent
Proposition,” Curtiss Bruno asked: “Hey Darlene, want to
come by and check out the romance section of our
newest catalog?” Funny. The TV commercials had led me
to believe he might be tiring of the chase. Marta Dragelov
passed on some funny trivia from a book she was researching.
Peter Hoffman announced that he would be
out of the office the next week but would be keeping in
touch with electronic mail.</p>

<p class='c018'>So, yes, I could read the same e-mail as Darlene could.
But that still wasn’t full interactivity. I wanted a two-way,
and the “Compose” command intrigued me; perhaps I
could e-mail the crew behind the Darlene character. I
wrote that I was a real writer, working on a real book, for
a real publisher; could they please tell me what kind of responses
the people at Gramercy Press were getting over
the Internet? <em>And how about Darlene?</em></p>

<p class='c018'>“What’s she like?” I was thinking. “How’d those people
choose her? Does she enjoy computers? Has she been on the
Net?” Once I established contact with the virtual Darlene’s
keepers, perhaps I could find out.</p>

<p class='c018'>Having already snooped at Darlene’s e-mail, I went on
to the offices of the other characters. Ellen deRosset, a
dark-haired woman dressed in black, confided that she
had corrected her seventh-grade teacher’s grammar. “I
read <cite>War and Peace</cite> when I was fifteen. The complete
works of Balzac before I was twenty-five. I think you get
the picture. So I am not happy that I was given the assignment
to edit this ‘women in sports’ book. I dislike sports
rather intensely. The only sport I know anything about,
really, is fencing. But one must be flexible these days, and
the MCI Business software makes this assignment easier
to handle, if not more palatable.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Reginald Gales told me how MCI’s e-mail and conferencing
services came in handy. One of his authors lived
on a caboose in Wyoming, while another wrote from a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>houseboat in Florida; “he once had a shark bite off his TV
antenna.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Marta Dragelov, the fact checker, was an avid user of
MCI’s news-flash service, which crammed her computer
with such items as, “India Asks Phone Firms to Set Up
Local Factories”—actual news stories that I could see
while clicking on them. Peter Hoffman was away at home
and working in his pajamas. Martin Banks, the technophobic
editor, said he was “being tutored on the wonders
of MCI electronic office ephemera by none other than
Miss Ellen deRosset.” He hoped that she would notice his
new pair of wing tips.</p>

<p class='c018'>The real payoff for readers was in Curtiss Bruno’s office.
Wearing a striped shirt and a tie and looking like an
incurable office politician, he nevertheless held a hand
over his mouth as if to say: “Maybe I’d better shut up before
I spill too much.” Oh, Curtiss, why bother? I could
tour an electronic version of the not-quite-completed winter
catalogue—with listings of fiction, visual arts, poetry,
and nonfiction.</p>

<p class='c018'>All categories carried dates older than the Web area
itself—MCI was apparently relying on imaginary contributors
to prime the pumps. “Ivana diTommaso’s” background
just seemed too <cite>New Yorker</cite>-ish. She had “grown
up in Bologna, Italy, and Grosse Pointe, Michigan” and had
“developed from a quiet film student” to “one of America’s
fine short story writers.” If she existed, the electronic catalogue
at the Library of Congress had yet to note it when I
made a short detour by way of my software’s task-switching
capability. Not that I trusted the catalogue. A branch of
Random House had published my first book, <cite>The Silicon
Jungle</cite>, yet it was missing from the LC catalogue that day;
and for all I knew, maybe the librarians had also neglected
the accomplished Ms. diTommaso. I charitably allowed for
the fact that she just might exist.</p>

<p class='c018'>Her story, “The Legend of Wendell County,” told how
a county records keeper had become a community
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>grandmother who, not content to record births, deaths,
and divorces, tried her hand at marriage counseling and
other social workish pursuits—until one day she lost her
way in winter and turned into something else, a ghost.
The bottom of the page carried an authentic-looking “©
1994 Ivana diTommaso.”</p>

<p class='c018'>I moved on. “The Tree House” was a story from Katy
Rudder, a member of “the first Peace Corps class ever assigned
to China, where she is teaching English at
Leshan Teachers College in the Sichuan Province.”
Based on what I was reading, MCI’s artistic tastes—or its
ad agency’s—were corporately wholesome. And so were
its contributors. I doubted that Gramercy would have
been the best place for the young Burroughs or Kerouac.</p>

<p class='c018'>Perhaps this would change, maybe Gramercy would
grow more adventurous with time, but right now I wasn’t
sanguine in that regard. The nonfiction area was a real
loss with just one title, of a harmless, theological type. I
doubted that this would be the place for, say, Seymour
Hersh or Robert Caro. Like the writing, the art looked
competent and maybe much better, but, again, safely
within corporate parameters.</p>

<p class='c018'>The most cautious contributors were MCI’s lawyers,
or whoever else had written the legalese for one Web site.
All writers and artists had to send in releases saying they
wouldn’t sue MCI for using accidentally similar material.
The lawyers warned, “All work that is submitted electronically
over the Internet needs to be accompanied by a hard
copy of the release form, sent in separately by postal mail.
We will not look at any work placed on our server until we
have received the hard copy of the release form. All files
on the server older than 14 days, for which we have not
received a release, will not be reviewed....” I remembered
the essay on theology. It was uninspired enough for
an attorney other than Scott Turow to have written it, and
sure enough, the author’s note said he was “happy with
the practice of law.”</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>Despite the less-than-striking short stories and the
soporific essay, I loved the sparkle of Gramercy Press as a
whole. I recalled an area on the Web known as Bianca’s
Smut Shack. Its creators let you get inside the head of a
virtual woman, let you know what books she read, what
movies she watched, what records she listened to, and
you could add your own opinions. At the time I’d told the
Shack crew, “Watch out, folks. Don’t be surprised if a big
company creates characters in an ad where <em>everyone</em>
buys the right products.” Well, it had happened. And MCI
and its advertising agency had done many good things
that people with their resources could more easily accomplish.</p>

<p class='c018'>Building Notre Dame, thousands of workers had
pieced together the stone, fashioned the gargoyles, assembled
the stained-glass windows. And the MCI Web area,
while hardly art, was somewhat like a cathedral. The
area’s masterminds had bungled in some ways, but they
had used sheer staff power to toil over countless details.</p>

<p class='c018'>I was sorry when Mark Pettit told me that some Real
People in Publishing had hated Gramercy Press. Didn’t
they get it? Granted, the publishing company was stereotypical
to the point of being self-satirizing. But so what? I
was no more expecting MCI to be a first-rate publisher
than I was expecting Random House to lay fiber-optic
cable.</p>

<p class='c018'>As a display of the Web’s potential to attract a mass
audience, of course, the Gramercy endeavor had triumphed.
For consumer business on the Net to take off,
ads would have to be a complete departure from those on
television, and MCI had done just that—even if it was
able to benefit from characters from the older medium.
Many small-timers could never have discovered an actress
as perfectly suited to play Darlene as Katy
Selverstone was. This was a real coup. MCI was brilliantly
drawing in a big crowd through a skillful interplay
of television, print, and the Net.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>Selverstone herself had become a living ad for MCI,
drawing stare after stare as she walked down the
Manhattan streets. Her Gramercy role was a real tribute
to her acting ability. <cite>Entertainment Weekly</cite> described her
as not “much of a gadget-head. ‘I’ve got a 12-inch, black-and-white
TV that emits a faint gaseous odor,’ she says.
‘And I have to change channels with a pair of pliers.’”
The word from MCI was that she’d just bought a computer
and would herself be on the Net. Advertisers hired
models today on the basis of looks and I wondered if, in
the future, they would consider the ability to give good
chat online.</p>

<p class='c018'>A major problem, however, arose with this scenario in
MCI’s case. While I hadn’t asked for an interview or
e-mail from the real Darlene, I had yet even to hear from
her handlers after six weeks. These people had wooed me
with a first-class Web area and encouraged me to write in,
and yet they had then ignored me except for a little boilerplate
from their <a id='corr64.19'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Darelene'>Darlene</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_64.19'><ins class='correction' title='Darelene'>Darlene</ins></a></span>-bot, who said she was busy coping
with “emergencies.” The MCI media crew reinforced
my skepticism; only after a series of phone calls was I able
to pry basic information. On a day when Pettit solemnly
promised he’d talked to me, he was off holding a press
conference for the <cite>Wall Street Journal</cite> and the other usual
suspects without alerting me about the postponement.
Clearly this was a big company focused on other big companies,
and I wondered if the small merchants in the Web
area might suffer if they entrusted their fates to MCI. I myself
was not just a writer. I made it clear that I was also a
customer of MCI Mail, an electronic mail service to which
I had subscribed for a decade. Perhaps someday I might
even want a Web area through MCI. And this was the
treatment I got?</p>

<p class='c018'>If MCI slighted me—a writer-customer who spoke out
in print and on the Net, and who had many friends
there—how would it treat the Larry Grants of the future? I
thought of the elusive, virtual character who had asked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>me to write to her. In a metaphorical sense, small merchants
might futilely spend their days searching for
Darlene. Now I wondered about Bob Lilienfeld. How was
he coming along with his own information request? Was
there <em>any</em> chance that White Rabbit might end up in an
electronic mall after all? Lilienfeld, albeit not a mall
booster, was in many ways a good prospect since he was
so Net oriented and could appreciate a good deal. Why, he
even owned stock in MCI.</p>

<p class='c018'>Efficiently, however, MCI had alienated Bob Lilienfeld.
Just like me, he had not heard a peep out of the company,
even after filling out a form for his two months of trial
services. He had followed up with three e-mail notes to
an address set aside for prospects like him. I told MCI’s
media people about this mini-debacle and was assured
that someone would contact Lilienfeld. But after several
weeks, no one had. MCI was nicely apologetic, of course.
Mark Pettit and colleagues reminded me of the huge
number of people who had replied to the Gramercy Press
ad. They said, too, that MCI technical people were busy at
work answering questions, while creative types handled
the correspondence for Darlene. But they were missing
the point. This was a massive advertising campaign, and
they should have planned for success as well as failure.</p>

<p class='c018'>The issue <em>should</em> not have had anything to do with
corporate size. MCI could have requested zip codes and
states and sorted out Darlene’s e-mail in that way—for
area sales reps to answer if her handlers in New York
were swamped. In fact, the form that Lilienfeld filled out
did ask for his postal address. It also inquired, “What
interests you?” so that, during the two-month trial, MCI
could mail him news stories through the new automatic
clipping service. “You can choose any topic: your competition’s
advertising, the future of your industry, or southwestern
cooking, anything,” MCI had assured him. And
yet, after six weeks, he hadn’t received a single call or
piece of literature.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>As if that weren’t enough of an outrage, MCI’s fees
might overwhelm many small business people. MCI
wanted to charge some $2,000 a month for getting them
on the World Wide Web—or at least several times what
many independent malls would have billed. Yes, MCI
talked about adding value through its brand name and
through customer draws such as directory services for
the Net and for voice. It would even line up copywriters
for the storefronts. But what good would this do merchants
whose volumes simply did not justify such expenditures?
Pettit reminded me that a quarter-page listing in
a phone directory cost $2,000. But that wasn’t true in
many areas, and most merchants did not take out that
much space anyway. Even then the typical business person
might hire an extra clerk, and perhaps have money
left over for advertising with a smaller cybermall. That, of
course, was projecting into the future. After all, even
Larry Grant wasn’t grossing more than $15,000-20,000 a
year at the time, and the Lilienfelds had a long climb
ahead to reach that level.</p>

<p class='c018'>Perhaps MCI would learn. I still loved the sparkle of
the Gramercy area and hoped that it would thrive in the
end. Regardless of my doubts and frustrations, I hadn’t
anything against the people of MCI, especially Mark Pettit,
who, despite his absentmindedness, had actually been
more helpful than the others. MCI wasn’t Canter and
Siegel. It hadn’t disrupted Usenet. As long as it paid its own
way and did not take advantage of its Net connections in
ways that stifled competition—Washington needed to
monitor MCI closely—then it could actually help the average
Net user. The greater the volume on the Net, the
greater would be the virtual pipeline and the lower the cost
for everyone. So, far from disliking MCI’s interest in the
commercial promise of the Net, I still saw plenty of potential
here. MCI simply needed to understand the obvious. If
its electronic marketplace were to succeed, then the company
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>must price its services more realistically and not
keep customers searching for Darlene.</p>

      <div class='line'>Absolutely, Positively on the Net</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c018'>A FedEx woman called me up and asked what the people
in Memphis could do to retain my business, which had
plummeted to almost zero volume. “You’ve given me great
service,” I said, thinking of all the foot-to-throttle occasions
when FedEx had picked up manuscripts on deadline. “But
you see, I’m on the Internet nowadays. <em>Everything</em> for my
current book project goes ever the wire.” I was working on
a guide telling how to lobby for one’s political beliefs online,
and the publisher had even received the book proposal
via the Net. Lots of people were doing the same, not
just with the Net but with commercial services and fax. On
legal lists, some lawyers were debating the validity of electronic
mail for business matters, but the new technology
would quiet the discussion soon enough when foolproof,
digital signatures could establish the identity of the sender.</p>

<p class='c018'>No one needs to weep for FedEx, United Parcel Service,
and the rest, however. The typical computer is a medium-sized
box full of parts that come in much smaller boxes,
such as a disk drive or a modem. And, as shown by the
thickness of <cite>Computer Shopper</cite> and other magazines that
cater to computer users buying from afar, FedEx and similar
services are thriving. That is just one example. High-tech
companies, especially the network kind, want
reputations for reliability and fast turnarounds. They love
the FedEx slogan: “When it absolutely, positively, has to be
there overnight.” Courier services are godsends for corporations
that rely on just-in-time delivery to reduce inventories
of spare parts. If nothing else, this principle appeals to
manufacturers with slim inventories. Also, more and more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>people are working at home. At the same time, upscale
consumer magazines abound with ads touting merchandise
via express, everything from steaks to flowers.</p>

<p class='c018'>The real question, then, isn’t how to downsize but
rather how to cope with the deluge of business in small
packages. And Federal Express views the Internet as
among the more promising of many possibilities.</p>

<p class='c018'>For years, FedEx used its own network to set up computer
links through which high-volume, Fortune 500
companies could request pickups, track shipments, and
receive invoices. First, FedEx communicated with mainframes.
Then it began supplying some customers with
personal computers; eventually, some companies shipping
as few as three packages a day could qualify. “We
started with the biggest customers first and then extended
that service to smaller and smaller companies,” said
Robert Hamilton, a marketer at FedEx dealing with information
matters. The next move was supplying tracking
software through which people could use their own machines
to dial up FedEx. Step by step, FedEx was working
to get almost <em>all</em> customers online to its computers—even
the operators of small home businesses.</p>

<p class='c018'>The Internet could play an important role here because
it is the closest thing to a universal computer network.
By the mid-1990s people in the air freight business
caught on to the advantages of the Net over the proprietary
networks in many cases. The Internet reached scores of
countries, no small advantage in an internationally oriented
business, and planners could use the Net’s volume to
help slash the costs of telecommunications <em>and</em> improve
service to customers. Right-O-Way, a freight forwarder in
Tustin, California, was among the Net pioneers. Back in
1992 the company had figured out how to use customers’
personal computers to print out bar code labels.</p>

<p class='c018'>With portable radio-frequency scanners linked to the
firm’s mainframe, Right-O-Way’s workers could track
shipments for customers—could, in other words, offer the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>same services that <a id='corr69.1'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Fed'>Ex</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_69.1'><ins class='correction' title='Fed'>Ex</ins></a></span> could. Right-O-Way’s customers
dialed up the company directly rather than
through the Internet. But in 1994, Martin Hubert, vice
president of information systems, hooked Right-O-Way
into the Net for customers wanting to use it. He spent just
$1,000 on additional UNIX software, modems, network
setup charges, and programming time, and $350 a month
in Internet-related bills.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Some customers have tried it already,” Hubert said.
“We have sales people use the Internet to access shipping
data. Our advanced overseas partners can access our
computer directly for e-mail, tracking, and tracing.
Customers like BMW, ClothesTime, and Packard Bell access
our computer and save money on long-distance
charges from overseas.”<a id='r2.7' /><a href='#f2.7' class='c022'><sup>[2.7]</sup></a> Those companies could reach
the Right-O-Way computer directly, getting immediate answers
while they were online. Using the Net, they could
even schedule shipments. Right-O-Way told me that it
protected account numbers by requiring customers to use
passwords that they received through sales reps and ways
other than the Internet.</p>

<p class='c018'>What’s more, the company served even customers
having only the most basic of Internet connections. Yes,
you could Telnet into the Right-O-Way computer system
on the Internet—could issue commands as if you were at
a keyboard at headquarters. But if you lacked Telnet capabilities
and didn’t mind the delay, you could also send
electronic mail messages in the appropriate format to
track shipments or issue pickup orders.<a id='r2.8' /><a href='#f2.8' class='c022'><sup>[2.8]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c018'>Around the same time, FedEx and other industry
giants were gearing up to do business on the Internet. The
Net, of course, wasn’t the only possibility. Federal Express
by then was an old hand at using its own network, which
at the time accounted for more than 50 percent of the
packages shipped. It was also distributing Windows and
Mac software to enable tracking through the FedEx net.
Just the same, in December 1994, after having earlier
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>experimented with the Net for the distribution of press releases,
FedEx turned to the Internet’s World Wide Web as
a way for customers to track packages. Within FedEx’s
Web area, they could key in the number of the package
and get the latest information.</p>

<p class='c018'>I checked out the Web service. At www.fedex.com I
saw “FedEx” in big purple and orange letters, along with a
short, easy menu that led me to electronic forms. A detour
offered “Interesting Facts about FedEx!” It was the “world’s
largest express transportation company,” had 1994 revenues
of $8.5 billion, employed “more than 505,515 worldwide,”
served 191 countries, owned more than 400 aircraft
ranging from 32 Fokker F-27s to 5 Airbuses and 13
McDonnell Douglas MD-11s, operated “more than 32,560
vehicles, and shipped an average of more than 2 million
packages each day.” Another menu item could tell me
about pickup availability. If I typed in the time I would have
a shipment ready to go, my zip code, and the destination
code, among other items, then FedEx would tell me how
soon it could deliver the package using Priority Overnight
Service or alternatives.</p>

<p class='c018'>Right now, however, I wanted to learn the whereabouts
of a test package—containing nothing more than
Robert Hamilton’s business card—that went out under
airbill number 50044562. It was a no-brainer. I chose
“Select Track a FedEx Package” and keyed in the number.
Almost immediately I learned when a courier had picked
up the package and when it had left Memphis. And eventually
the Web would pass on other facts such as the name
of the driver at the destination, the delivery time, and who
signed for the package. An idea hit me. When you filled
out an express form in the future, perhaps you could give
both your recipient’s e-mail address and your own. Via the
Net, a service could tell the other person that a package
was on the way—and after it arrived, you’d automatically
receive a receipt.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>Even as the FedEx area existed now, however, it was
serving customer needs well. Yes, I appreciated the flash
of MCI’s efforts, and I understood why Darlene and
friends were attracting many more people than the
courier company was right now. But compared to MCI,
FedEx left me feeling <em>better</em>. Those modest little electronic
forms, the ones that would let me track packages and
check out <a id='corr71.8'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Fed'>Ex’s</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_71.8'><ins class='correction' title='Fed'>Ex’s</ins></a></span> service availability by location and
time, treated the customers as individuals and responded
in seconds. MCI, however, ignored Bob Lilienfeld, who,
disgusted, later sold his stock.</p>

<p class='c018'>On top of everything else, MCI, which had vastly more
programming talent than FedEx did, had missed out on
some major opportunities for interactive software. I could
imagine a small company keying in a description of its
telecommunications and network requirements and getting
a series of at least basic recommendations. On a
package-by-package basis and in the most private of ways,
FedEx was doing this already—since its forms queried
you about your shipping needs of the moment and then
told you what services were available. The people at MCI
weren’t dumb. They could turn around their operation in
a flash—they might have done so by the time you read
this—but in terms of customer service FedEx was clearly
the winner right now.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Five years from now,” said Robert Hamilton, “35 or
40 percent of the customers connected to FedEx could be
using the Internet.” His company stood a good chance of
saving millions in annual communications costs and the
expenses of staffing phones. “The big factor is how individuals
are connected today,” he said. “With CompuServe
and America Online galloping in the direction of
the Internet, maybe that will happen sooner rather than
later.” FedEx would let customer usage, not official corporate
policy, drive its use of the Net, and that is exactly
how it should be. One way or another the Net would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>definitely figure in its plans. The only question was,
“How much?”</p>

<p class='c018'>The big need now, of course, was for customers to be
able to key in their account numbers and get immediate
pickups. FedEx did face some challenges here. FedEx
needed to blend the Internet into its existing network of
computers, and this complicated the security issues.
FedEx wanted to make certain that a cyberthief couldn’t
go on a joyride with an illegally obtained account number
of a customer. So it was evaluating security-enhanced
software from CommerceNet, a California organization
that helped put businesses on the Net. Meanwhile, we
customers could not use the Net to schedule shipments
through Federal Express. FedEx had offered a temporary
solution: we could at least download software that let us
call up the company directly, or we could reach FedEx via
America Online or another commercial network. That
would do for the moment.</p>

<p class='c018'>Mulling over what I’d seen and heard up to now, I
could not escape three conclusions. First, it was clear that
computer networks could be a help, not a threat, to delivery
companies that were trying to upgrade service. No
longer would I have to wait for an operator to schedule a
pickup or check on shipments from FedEx. The second
conclusion was broader: The Net often could be good for
corporations of <em>all</em> sizes, not just Fortune 500 firms like
FedEx. Right-O-Way had staked out its own place in cyberspace
by going for the simplest solution—Telnet and
electronic mail—rather than worrying first about the
World Wide Web. The company could add the Web later.
On the Internet, with its inherent economies for the Right-O-Ways
of this world, “smaller” didn’t have to mean
“backwards.”</p>

<p class='c018'>The third conclusion about these case histories resulted
from my comparisons of MCI and the courier companies,
and it transcended the fact that they were in
different industries. Even on the Internet, good customer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>service would have to be a company’s first priority and
counted even more than the technology per se. Oh, you
could use electronic forms. But unless you programmed
the forms to provide the right services—rather than simply
trying to sell The Product and awe the customers—you
might actually alienate the people you were trying to befriend.
MCI didn’t understand this sufficiently. FedEx and
Right-O-Way did.</p>

      <div class='line'>Advertising Sticker into a Warning Label</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c018'>The Internet, of course, can hurt as well as help business.
Well populated with skeptical academics—whose
postings often find their way onto the screens of equally
skeptical journalists—the Net is a good place to learn
about scams. Legitimate companies, of course, needn’t
worry: They will benefit as word of their successful products
spreads, and the Net excels as a conduit for rumor
control. Should there ever be another Tylenol scare, you
can bet that publicists will use the Net to get the truth out.
Even legitimate businesses, however, can feel the wrath of
the Net if they err—as Intel, the chip maker, found out in
the ugliest of ways after it released the Pentium chip.</p>

<p class='c018'>The Pentium chip was the new flagship product, the
speedster that would let PCs impinge on minicomputer
territory. But that wasn’t all. Intel envisioned the Pentium
as the perfect chip for computers aimed at the home market.
No longer would Mom, Pop, and The Kids poke along
with computers weaker than those at the office. Thanks to
Intel, they would enjoy glitzy cartoons, educational programs,
and other multimedia offerings in full glory on
their machines at home. Intel launched a major TV campaign
and persuaded scores of computer makers to adorn
their boxes and ads with “Intel Inside” stickers. Intel was
looking ahead to millions of dollars of Christmas-related
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>sales. At the time, I suspect, the Internet didn’t figure that
prominently in Intel’s plans. Its Net area was hardly as
dazzling or as ambitious as those of many other companies.
That would change.</p>

<p class='c018'>The trouble started when a mathematics professor in
Virginia found that under certain conditions, the Pentium
chip would make mistakes in arithmetic. There at
Lynchburg College, Dr. Thomas Nicely couldn’t believe
his screen. To his amazement, he was able to verify that
the chip, not the human, was at fault here. In October
1994 the professor’s “Bug in the Pentium” memo went out
over the Internet. It circulated rapidly from mailing list to
mailing list, from newsgroup to newsgroup, as well as on
commercial nets such as CompuServe and Prodigy.</p>

<p class='c018'>Pentium-hostile messages flew back and forth between
scientists, corporate executives, consultants, and
other influential people, who, thanks to the Internet,
could share complaints more efficiently than ever. Intel
tried some damage control via the Net and in press statements.
The heat reached the point where the head of
Intel asked a underling to issue an apology and a technical
explanation. The message betrayed corporate panic,
pure and simple. “I am posting from my home system,”
Richard Wirt, Director of Software Technology, prefaced
a weekend note. And then came an “I am truly sorry”
message from Andy Grove, President of Intel. In various
statements Intel assured customers that the average computer
user would typically run across the problem once
every 27,000 years. The official line was that nontechnical
people needn’t worry. Intel announced it would replace
chips <em>if</em> people could show that the defect could harm
their work.</p>

<p class='c018'>That still didn’t placate the Net and the media. Netwise
reporters at papers such as the <cite>Washington Post</cite> and <cite>New
York Times</cite> and at <cite>Newsday</cite> warned the thousands of
Christmas shoppers who were about to buy $2,000
Pentium machines. Billions of dollars were at stake here.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>Computer makers had already moved millions of Pentium
machines, and IBM came out with a statement saying that
it would replace defective chips—even though Intel kept
claiming that the nontechnical need not worry. It didn’t
help when shoppers learned that Intel knew about the
Pentium’s defects as early as June.</p>

<p class='c018'>What most threatened the Pentium, however, may
have been the humor. It started on the Net and, via mailing
lists such as On-Line News, reached major newspapers.
David Letterman started cracking jokes. Politicians
and chips had something in common. If still quite alive
when Letterman ridiculed it, the Pentium was headed toward
the emergency room afterward—given the speed
with which the story was traveling around. On the Net itself,
and on the front pages, typical Pentium humor went
something like this:</p>

<p class='c030'>Q. “How many Pentium designers does it take to
screw in a light bulb?”</p>

<p class='c031'>A. “1.99904274017, but that’s close enough for nontechnical
people.”</p>

<p class='c031'>Q. “What do you get when you cross a Pentium PC
with a research grant?”</p>

<p class='c031'>A. “A mad scientist.”</p>

<p class='c031'>Q. “What’s another name for the “Intel Inside” sticker
they put on Pentiums?”</p>

<p class='c031'>A. “The warning label.”</p>

<p class='c024'>Maintaining to the end that this was more of a marketing
problem than a technical one, Intel relented. It agreed
to replace chips for free without interrogating the public.
What’s more, Intel expanded its presence on the Net. It
now offered a nice area on the World Wide Web with
items ranging from product descriptions to job announcements.
Still, this fiasco aside, Intel had a good reputation
for quality control, and by not shrinking from the Net
community, it was responding correctly.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>Another major lesson should also have sunk in
among marketers of all kinds—beyond the obvious fact
that the Internet could spread news of flawed products.
Customers throughout the world could use the same
channels to find out about geographically based price
gouges. If a software firm charged reasonable prices in
the United States but boosted price tags for Europeans,
then the Net would spread the word. Software companies
might not appreciate this immediately, but sooner or later
they would. This was especially true of companies sending
their products over the Net. The Internet Adapter, the
product that had proven to be so good to my wallet, would
have cost me $25 even if I’d lived in Antarctica or New
Zealand. I wondered how long it would be before the traditional
vendors of shrink-wrapped software would understand
this lesson and stop squeezing customers
outside the United States. Even with the expenses of middle
people and translation factored in, the prices of some
American software products were too high in Europe.
Consumerism on the Net just might make the marketplace
more sane.</p>

<div class='textbox1 width45'>

<p class='c018'>Other Hazards For Business People</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>Not surprisingly, the old sixties people saw the Internet
as a victory of smallness over big corporations. Little companies
could use the Net in new and imaginative ways and
woo prospects thousands of miles away. Some enthusiasts
promoted the Net as a powerful weapon for individuals
who hated life in sluggish, bloated corporations.</p>

<p class='c018'>Still, the Net might not always be a Nirvana for small
entrepreneurs. Consider the Lilienfelds. What if toy companies
decided to sell on the Net directly, for example?
The Lilienfelds themselves could still fare well since they
were working hard to become known for personal service.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>For example, if a toy weren’t shown online, Bob
might even scan in a photo from a wholesaler’s catalogue
and e-mail it to an interested buyer. And he and his wife
were planning to make themselves a conspicuous presence
in relevant newsgroups, while respecting netiquette.
But not all of the small merchants would be as astute and
dedicated. I suspected that many bankruptcies lay ahead.</p>

<p class='c018'>Other problems might hit large as well as tiny companies.
Many customers refused to give their credit card
numbers online; in fact, many stores didn’t even <em>want</em>
them. The Net wasn’t entirely secure. Theoretically,
snoops in a number of locations could intercept orders
and pick up the MasterCard or VISA numbers with software
that looked for common data associated with credit
cards. I regarded this as a temporary problem. Lilienfeld
had dealt with it nicely by letting people—at least those in
the United States—phone in their credit card numbers for
free. The numbers would remain safe in White Rabbit’s
computers, ready for future transactions. Besides, as
Lilienfeld pointed out, it wasn’t worth the trouble for
thieves to keep a tab on small stores like his.</p>

<p class='c018'>Bigger businesses, however, were right to worry, and
solutions were on the way. Popular browsers such as
Netscape, for example, were coming with security features.
Customers would be able to effortlessly transmit
their credit card numbers in encoded form.</p>

<p class='c018'>What about the problem of customers without sufficient
funds to pay for merchandise? Some Web merchants
could almost instantly verify that a customer had enough
money in a credit account. The process would be even
easier if companies such as Microsoft followed through
with plans to team up with credit card companies. But
that still left another worry for customers—privacy.</p>

<p class='c018'>If you use old-fashioned paper money, your transactions
aren’t traceable. With electronic money—or with
regular credit or conventional debit cards—they might be.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>What if you were a gay woman, lived in a small Arkansas
town, and enjoyed lesbian literature? Or suppose that in
the future you were caught up in a divorce and your wife
employed a cyberdetective to snoop on your spending
habits? DigiCash, a company in Amsterdam, thought it
had a solution in the form of anonymous electronic
money that you could spend without being traced. Only
your digital banker would know for sure. The possibility,
of course, gave fits to tax collectors throughout the world.
It was one of the reasons why bureaucrats in the United
States had lobbied so hard for industry to adopt the
Clipper chip, which allowed federal snoops to break its
codes. Clearly, however, the Clipper effort could <em>harm</em>
U.S. companies. Suppose foreign governments used a
similar approach—making it easier to steal commercial
secrets from American-owned multinationals?</p>

<p class='c018'>Still another threat to business is from people who
might spy on or change data on corporate systems.
Hackers got into General Electric computers containing
secrets. The solution to these electronic thefts, in many
cases, was stronger “firewalls”—electronic gateways between
public and private areas. In some instances, however,
the threat was exaggerated. Yes, in theory, hackers
could turn your home phone into a pay phone or make off
with your corporate password or spy on your electronic
mail. And some hated commercial activities on the Net
and were ready to act. But by far, these were exceptions:
most of the better hackers were benign—they saw themselves
more as scholars than as snoops and saboteurs.
Indeed, old-timers would not use the word “hackers” to
describe the malevolent; no, they were “crackers.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Ironically, on the Net, the real worry isn’t hackers but
snoopy competitors, who, without necessarily breaking
the law, can find out information about prices and new
products much more efficiently than before. A rival phone
company has paid thousands and thousands of visits to the
MCI area on the Web. This must be going on constantly.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>Earlier, Digital Equipment Corporation offered software
demonstrations over the Net and found that its competitors
were tying the machines up. More scrupulously, companies
could use powerful searching tools such as the Lycos
on the Web to seek out files mentioning rivals’ products.
They could also send the names of rivals to a computer at
Stanford University. And then whenever a company was
mentioned in a major Usenet newsgroup, an electronic
clipping service would send the information back to them
at no charge. A careless engineer or marketer could jeopardize
thousands or millions in investments. The answer,
of course, is to educate people about the risks.</p>

<p class='c018'>Not so controllable is the risk of companies using the
Net to troll for unfavorable mentions of rivals—grist for
negative advertising. There is only one solution: make
better products or give better service.</p>

<hr class='c032' />

<p class='c018'>Of the goods and services discussed here, a major
kind is conspicuously missing so far: entertainment.
Some of the best is free. Just ahead you’ll find a favorite of
many Netfolks—the Internet Underground Music Archive,
from which you can download free samples from top hits
as well as surprises from new musicians.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c017'>Don’t count on the Ugly Mugs pushing Billy Joel off
the charts, or even showing up at your closest record
store.</p>

<p class='c018'>They’re zany, avant-garde musicians whose work is a
cross between Frank Zappa and freakish, carnival rock—not
the stuff of the Top 40. But Jeff Patterson, a thin, pale
guitarist with a fondness for old jeans and green-topped
sneakers, can still spread the word about himself and the
other Mugs. Their music is on the Internet. Fans as far off
as Turkey and Japan can dial the Internet Underground
Music Archive run by Patterson and his “co-czar,” Rob
Lord. Hundreds of musicians are suddenly in cyberspace.
For just $100 a year they can pay IUMA to post cuts from
their music, complete with information on how you can
send away for the CDs and tapes. In fact, some have even
posted complete songs to the Net for free.</p>

<p class='c018'>Tens of thousands of Netfolk a week dial up IUMA,
making 200,000 page-accesses—perhaps a third of the attention
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>that <cite>Playboy</cite> gets, but still one of the best numbers
on the Web. That’s no small feat: The archive more or less
started in a tiny room with a bare lightbulb dangling from
the ceiling, and it is still a low-budget operation run by
two information science majors.</p>

<p class='c018'>IUMA is just one of many delights on the Net for
techies and technophobes alike. Entertainment and culture
are taking off in a major way in cyberspace just when
clueless Snubbites are deriding the Net as artless. I can
enjoy gifted but unheralded performers, from reggae
artists to banjo players. The New Zealand Symphony is
online with a digitized rendition of the national anthem
down there. Imagine the possibilities for fans of classical
music in the future—the chances to hear live performances
of Tchaikovsky directly from Moscow, or enjoy
classical Chinese music from Peking or Taipei. Net.radio
is already here. WYXC, for example, a station at the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, sends rock
music into the ether twenty-four hours a day.</p>

<p class='c018'>Running software called RealAudio, owners of deluxe
home computers can hear top-ten rap from an Internet
site in South Korea, astrological forecasts from England,
and selected programs from ABC News, National Public
Radio, the C-SPAN cable network, the radio version of the
<cite>Christian Science Monitor</cite>, the National Press Club, the
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, and a wealth of other
draws whenever they want—even weeks or months after
the original broadcasts.</p>

<p class='c018'>Just a mouse click on the right Web address conjures
up a Daniel Schorr commentary, or a feature about the
Illinois reporter whom the mob supposedly buried in concrete,
or scads of other NPR offerings that I wish I could
have enjoyed when they first aired. I don’t have to bother
with tricky downloads of files containing the sound. This
happens on its own.</p>

<p class='c018'>RealAudio sounds rather muffled right now, at least
on my computer, as if the technology is a throwback to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>1920s radio. But sooner or later it will make FM stereo
seem antediluvian.</p>

<p class='c018'>Consider, too, the diversity of programming from
grassroots people who can broadcast at a fraction of the
costs of even peanut-whistle stations. Thousands of
mom-and-pop sites—unencumbered by the Federal
Communications Commission, unless the nanny faction
wins out in D.C. and cracks down on the Net—may be
online in the next year or two. What happens when unpopular
political beliefs spread around this way? Will the
Oklahoma City tragedy be invoked to squelch RealAudio
and equivalents?</p>

<p class='c018'>Cheerier possibilities may arise. Someday you might
go hiking in the middle of the Rockies and be able to tune
in performances and talk shows from all over the world
through a net.satellite link; never mind the limits of the
local radio stations.</p>

<p class='c018'>Even video transmission will be routine over the Net
or a successor. And then what? When Michael Moriarty, a
TV actor, appeared in a public Q &amp; A session on Prodigy,
the possibilities made him wonder if network television
would go the way of vinyl records. “Television,” he told
the <cite>New York Times</cite>, “might become the 33-1/3 of the visual
arts.”</p>

<p class='c018'>For the moment, however, the Net is Fan Central for
television along with other media. David Letterman fans
and those of Jay Leno debate the merits of their favorite
talk show hosts, while major movie studios preview their
megahits with video clips. Elvis is alive and well in an
area on the Web. And just when we Netfolks are ridiculing
the TV moguls’ dream of 500 channels of <cite>Terminator</cite>
movies, Hollywood has used our Net to ballyhoo <cite>Junior</cite>—a
comedy starring the Terminator himself, Arnold
Schwarzenegger. As if that isn’t enough, Hollywood has
just released <cite>The Net</cite>, a thriller with some evil techies;
let’s see what the marketers will post on the Web to push
<em>that</em> one. Lower on the show business hierarchy, you can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>find model Danielle Ash replying to questions, in
alt.sex.breasts, about her double Fs.</p>

<p class='c018'>Netfolks with more elevated tastes can dial up the
WebMuseum, Paris, or check out the works of new digital
artists from Boston or New York or dozens of other big
cities. Obviously the Net isn’t the same as beholding a
Rembrandt in Holland and gazing into the face of a local
man or woman a few feet away. That’s screamingly clear.
Stoll, the near Snubbite, correctly notes that “Rembrandt
painted real people—their facial features and mannerisms
live on today in the Dutch population. Dressed in period
costumes, I’ll bet the security guard with his war
medals and the young woman tour guide would look as if
they stepped out of one of those incredibly detailed paintings.”
Moving and true. Imagine, however, the benefits of
the WebMuseum to people without the Snubbites’ ability
to jet to Amsterdam or Paris. What’s more, the Web brings
its own glories to compensate; I can view Artist X’s work,
then call up text about the person or the times; if anything
the Web can provide <em>more</em> context than do the skimpy
handouts available at most museums.</p>

<p class='c018'>Caviling away, Stoll also objects that computers can’t
reproduce the art exactly. But colors and resolution will
just keep improving. The Snubbites who rant about lost
details remind me of the foes of electronic books; incorrectly,
given the ease of digitizing everything, the foes
worry that new technology could kill off distinctive type-faces.
But we shouldn’t preserve art and literature just by
attending to the detail work. Culture also needs a place in
the public mind; da Vinci-class art should be free, or close
to it, by way of the Net. That is surely the ethos of Nicholas
Pioch. An ex-Microsoft intern now studying economics in
his native France, he is behind the WebMuseum, Paris,
the new name it bears, now that bureaucrats won’t let
him say, “Le WebLouvre.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Within Le <a id='corr83.36'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='WebLouve'>WebLouvre</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_83.36'><ins class='correction' title='WebLouve'>WebLouvre</ins></a></span>—there, I’ll say it anyway—I saw
such da Vincis as <cite>Mona Lisa</cite> and <cite>Virgin and Child with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>the Infant John the Baptist and St. Anne</cite>. I went on to look
at Rembrandts, van Goghs, Cezannes, Dalis, Klees, and
Manets, among others, and to read two warnings. “If you
think the law prevents you from viewing these exhibits,
you should stop now and do something more interesting,
such as flying to Paris and touring live!” Pioch wrote.
“Some companies may be trying to get a monopolistic
grab on arts and culture,” he said elsewhere, “developing
a pay-per-view logic, shipping out CD-ROMs while trying
to patent stuff which belongs to each of us: a part of <em>our</em>
human civilization and history.”</p>

<p class='c018'>How right Pioch was. Bill Gates has just bought a
notebook of Leonardo da Vinci, and let’s hope that like
some of the old robber barons, Gates will habitually share
his acquisitions with the world. But a major difference
shows up here. Andrew Carnegie and the rest did not
make their money off art and entertainment, part of Gates’
master plan. For Bill Gates to give away great paintings
and manuscripts will be like Carnegie giving away steel.
His motives may be the most ethereal, and with a $10-billion
net worth, he can afford many a donation; but a conflict
will forever arise between Gates the businessman
and Gates the philanthropist. Just which side will prevail
when he dies? If not in life, then in death, by way of his
lawyers, will he have the decency to turn <em>all</em> his old masters
loose on the Net for free viewing? No judgments here.
Perhaps that day will come. He has already agreed to loan
the notebook to a museum.</p>

<p class='c018'>Old masters, of course, are far from the only Culture
on the Net, and I doubt that Bill Gates will be interested in
buying some of the other kind—especially Bianca’s Smut
Shack. Don’t ask me if Bianca exists. The Shack’s “trolls”
swear that she does. If so, maybe a good many Netfolks
know her at least slightly. They can click on a picture to
flit from room to room of her virtual apartment on the
Web, leave notes on the walls of her virtual bathroom,
enter her virtual music room to take in the latest jazz or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>rock, or engage virtually in sex acts with strangers in
Argentina or Brazil or San Francisco or wherever else
hormones fuel technology.</p>

<p class='c018'>Bianca’s proud trolls have not sold out their mascot;
the virtual Bianca lives on the Web for fun, not direct
money making. But sooner or later, elsewhere on the Net,
if this has not happened already, an ad agency will create
a fictitious character who buys CDs, foods, books, video
tapes, automobiles, and other products only from hidden
“sponsors”—not open, MCI-style ones (as described in
chapter 2). I’ll hope that day is far off. The FCC has had
problems enough regulating children’s TV; imagine what
could happen if supposedly educational areas knuckled
under to Madison Avenue. I’m not sure if laws are the solution
here, but it would behoove Net providers to come
up <em>now</em> with rules against that sort of thing.</p>

<p class='c018'>In the fun areas of the Net, other dangers lurk for the
vulnerable. Millions of Netfolks enjoy role-playing in
imaginary worlds known as Multi-User Dungeons, where
they can be knights or damsels, regardless of gender—sometimes
men assume women’s roles to win more attention.
At the risk of sounding like Stoll and the Snubbites, I
have mixed feelings about the worth of MUD-style
diversions.</p>

<p class='c018'>A real potential exists for cocaine-heavy addiction—far
more than just regular Netsurfing, where you’re not
competing to rescue a fair maiden or dodge alien attacks.
Stories circulate of role-players who have kissed off good
grades and careers. Up in Canada, one player got so
wrapped up in his game that my researcher found him
amid wall-to-wall trash as he struggled to balance his
schoolwork and role-playing.</p>

<p class='c018'>Just like online groups for depressed people, however,
MUDs and similar areas can bring shy Netfolks together
face to face. I heard of several romances, in fact, that the
games led to. Risks notwithstanding, games do more good
than harm if players just know when to quit. Like it or not,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>among millions of Netfolks, MUDs and cousins are as
much a part of the Internet as the Web and @ signs.</p>

<p class='c018'>Of all the entertainment on the Net, however, the musical
and video kinds could most intrigue the masses as
the technology takes off; with just a modem, a reasonably
powerful computer, and a $100 sound card, you can hear
the offerings of IUMA and similar areas. You don’t even
need programs such as Mosaic or Netscape if you know
what you’re doing. People with cheapie dial-up connections
and no frills software can download rock albums
and the rest. Granted, the technology as a whole could be
better, and even using IUMA can tax the wallets and patience
of some. In most cases you’ll spend more time
downloading the music—from a remote machine to your
own—than you will hearing it. Fidelity on some setups
may be just this side of a tin can. But that’s now. Wait.</p>

<p class='c018'>Transmissions in the future will zip along through
cable TV connections to the Internet, or through ISDN<a id='r3.1' /><a href='#f3.1' class='c022'><sup>[3.1]</sup></a>
phone connections. Then you’ll truly be able to use the
Net as a jukebox and <em>hear</em> what you click on with your
mouse. What’s more, even now, with the right software,
you can enjoy almost CD-ROM-quality fidelity from
areas such as IUMA. Audio was the next step up after
text, of course, and, yes, video is on the way. Techies already
have mounted gigabyte after gigabyte of amateur
videos on the Net. Sooner or later, directors of little films
will enjoy a monster-sized IUMA-style archive. Perhaps
Rob Lord and Jeff Patterson, those co-czars of IUMA, will
run <em>it</em>, too.</p>

<p class='c018'>If you think that the $10-billion-a-year recording industry
is a little nervous, you’re right. In early 1994 Lord
told the <cite>San Jose Mercury News</cite>: “We want to kill the
record companies.” He and Patterson have backed off
since then; they’ve even helped Warner and other giants
set up Net areas of their own. IUMA’s own 500-act selection
is pathetic compared to those at the largest record
stores. Still, think about the long run: The IUMA model
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>just might jeopardize the seven-digit salaries of top
recording executives. After all, if the Net can advertise
music and even be used to take orders—perhaps with
electronic forms—just what becomes of the big studios?
They themselves will sell music directly over the Net, but
with heavy competition.</p>

<p class='c018'>The bypass-the-middle-man idea could apply in other
ways. What about radio hosts, for example? Suppose they
can reach people all over the world through the Internet,
and perhaps ultimately through wireless connections
based on the Net. Will they need CBS or NBC or ABC or
equivalents as much as they do now? I can already download
snippets from, say, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.
Too, just what will be the fate of art dealers if so
much of art goes digital and people can discover artists on
their own without leaving their living rooms? Publishers of
newspapers, magazines, and books, of course, are in a
quandary—see the next chapter on electronic publishing.</p>

<p class='c018'>In some ways I don’t envy the big guys. IUMA is
clearly wired into the Internet, while companies such as
CBS, at least at this point, are fumbling in some respects.
Many of the amateurs on the Net are actually coming up
with better offerings than are the professionals. When I
dropped by, the official Letterman page on the WWW was
far from an abomination, and yet at the same time it
showed the problems here.</p>

<p class='c018'>The page indeed was full of odds and ends about how
to get <cite>Late Show</cite> tickets, Letterman’s upcoming guests, his
top-ten lists (the one for the April 13th broadcast was on
“Ways CBS Can Raise Money,” with number one being “A
two-hour paycheck freeze on Letterman”), and the rest.
But where were the connections with the rest of the Net,
especially the many Letterman fans out there? How about
the fans’ Letterman pages? Or relevant mailing lists or
newsgroups? Perhaps they were there but hidden, but
whatever the case the cyberspace Letterman was less hip
than the one on The Box.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>To Letterman’s credit, he didn’t fake things. He publicly
confessed he was ignorant of data ways. But in my
opinion, his Web people could have done better.</p>

<p class='c018'>Moving on to the CBS home page, I saw an offer for
me to “Join the EYE ON THE NET club. That way we can
send you more information about CBS and its programs.
You can also take part in special previews and other interactive
events. Fill out the following registration form and
we’ll give you a special CBS screen saver just for joining.”
Oh, boy, that was just why I was on the Internet—to end
up on marketers’ lists. I didn’t blame CBS for trying; some
of Letterman’s fans would like the free software. But
surely the network could have done better.</p>

<p class='c018'>Aaron Barnhart, who put out a good little electronic
fan newsletter called <cite>Late Show News</cite>, defended Dave’s
people on the Net. “I think it’s great,” he said of the official
Letterman area. “All of these large entities are trying their
best to integrate with the interactive age. A lot of e-mail
gets passed that you never see, so don’t assume that just
because there aren’t any bulletin boards ... there is no interaction
happening.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Perhaps he was being kind to his sources for his
newsletter—I hadn’t any idea. What was clear was that he’d
made a second career of Lettermandom. He devoted twenty
to thirty hours a week to Letterman-related activities. Much
of his newsletter was a review of reviews (“Frank Rich of
the <cite>New York Times</cite> wrote one of his standard pitiless
columns last week on the Oscars broadcast, and we quote,
‘in which the belly-flopping David Letterman demonstrated
just how large a bullet he dodged by not moving his own
show to L.A.’”). Barnhart also served as owner of the Top
10 List (“60,000 subscribers and booming”).</p>

<p class='c018'>So what was Barnhart in it for? He was freelancing for
the <cite>Village Voice</cite>, and I could see where some attention
might do any writer’s career good, but if Barnhart even
wanted to be on <cite>The Late Show</cite> itself, he did a pretty good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>job of concealing that. “Attention is great,” he said, “but it
doesn’t pay the rent.” Did he send stuff into the show?
“No.” So why was Letterman so popular on the Net?
“Demographics.” Well-off computer owners just liked that
kind of program.</p>

<p class='c018'>I checked out the Letterman page maintained by Jason
A. Lindquist, an electronic engineering student at the
University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, a self-described
“Statistician, Smart-Ass-for-Hire, and Mac Programmer.” I
found references to newsgroup postings on such items as
“Dave instigates the feud with Bryant Gumbel with these
words,” “The great Stevie Nicks controversy of 1986,”
“Madonna—Your first choice to date your son,” and “No inside
stuff on the strong guy or the fat guy here.” And I saw
mentions of the newsletter, the Frequently Asked Questions
List, and at least two Letterman-related newsgroups. CBS
ought to hire this guy.</p>

<p class='c018'>It was time to move on to alt.fans.letterman. I did a
search within Netscape for the word “Leno” in the subject
header and found a post from an apparent Leno fan on the
attack: “Everyone knows that Jay Leno is way better than
ugly gap-tooth Dave!”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Oh,” replied one of the faithful, “you say that Jay Leno
is still on the air? Is it true that they use a wide-angle lens
to photograph that lantern jaw of his? Just wondering.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Letterman has more comedy in his little pinkie toe
than Leno will have in his wildest dreams,” said another
Davite, “and if Letterman is so ugly, who has all the models
and top actresses flirting with him and asking him to
go out—it certainly isn’t Leno.”</p>

<p class='c018'><em>That</em>, not the official Letterman area, was the true Net.
Just what might await the world if the inmates actually
ran the asylum and themselves mounted a major entertainment
effort rather than trusting the corporate world. It
had happened with the Internet Underground Music
Archives, and I liked the results.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span></div>
<div class='textbox1 width25'>

<p class='c018'>IUMA</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>The normal story is that IUMA began when Rob Lord
and Jeff Patterson, the co-czars, met in a newsgroup devoted
to supermodels. Both liked Kate Moss, a waify Calvin
Klein woman; strutting down the runways, she was lost
amid the big, bosomy knockouts favored by so many young
men on the Net. It turned out that Lord and Patterson were
both from Valencia, California, a far-north suburb of Los
Angeles. They knew each other slightly from William Hart
High School, both had worked in record stores while
teenagers, and both had both been attending the University
of California at Santa Cruz. That’s the story, and it’s true.</p>

<p class='c018'>IUMA, however, in another way, may have started not
on the Net but in the corporeal United Kingdom.</p>

<p class='c018'>Thousand and thousands of Brits were dancing to
synthesized <em>bleeps</em>, <em>conks</em>, <em>cooonkks</em>, <em>clunks</em>, <em>bomb-bombs</em>
and <em>tssss-tsss-tssses</em>, and odds and ends that I could never
even come close to reproducing here. The name of the
music was Rave, as in “raving mad,” and by the time Lord
was in high school in the 1980s, the craze had found its
way to Los Angeles.</p>

<p class='c018'>Middle-class white suburbanites, Latinos, Blacks, they
were all <em>bleep</em>ing and <em>conk</em>ing together, thousands of
them, risking the wrath of the fire department, overcrowding
the halls, going at it from 11 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> on, some dancing
twelve hours on into the morning.</p>

<p class='c018'>“No place in Los Angeles,” Lord said of the Rave halls,
“had such a peaceful coexistence as between these three
groups. They didn’t say anything. They shared the beats
and feelings and the technology. And on the Rave scene,
the person in charge is the DJ, and they’re sort of the cultural
funnel. The DJs were in charge of finding these odd
records that would come from Belgium and from the UK
and from Chicago, and there were some made-in-Los
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>Angeles things. They were hard to find, but the DJs
were responsible for scouting them out and bringing the
very latest <em>bleeps</em> and <em>conks</em> together.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“So,” I asked, thinking of IUMA and Lord’s chance to
bring the world to his listeners, “you liken yourself to
those DJs?”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Yeah, yeah!” Lord said enthusiastically. “I believe
IUMA is my personal implementation of Rave’s calling. I
just love working with technology and all those kinds of
things, and what Rave culture espoused was that there’s a
new revolution going on, an information revolution. You
know, one of the biggest stars of Rave music was a band
called Dee-Lite. And one of the first lines was, ‘From New
York City in the age of communication.’ And that means all
kinds of communications, a shrinking world, Internet, it
means ideas and the convergence of ideas.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Returning to the subject of his younger days, Rob Lord
told me how much he hated the Depeche Mode music that
was so popular in upper-middle-class neighborhoods like
his—the kind the record stores were selling. He wanted
his music from the clubs, from the 100-copy pressing, not
from the megaconglomerates offering the likes of
Depeche. “The lyrics were terrible, and the emotions were
feigned.” I’m sure Depeche fans might disagree. The
point, however, was that Depeche music was much more
readily available at record stores than Rave was, and Rob
grew unhappy with the distribution system.</p>

<p class='c018'>Jeff Patterson, working at a music store, just like Rob
Lord, was equally disgusted. Patterson and co-workers
“would sit there and talk about who’s making all the
money.” CDs cost $15-$17 at Music Plus, his employer.
Elsewhere they were around $12-$13. “And you know, we
were thinking like, ‘Where is that extra $4 being pocketed?’
You know, after all the costs were taken out, then
their manager would get paid, the record company would
get paid, people on the tour would get paid, and then the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>band would finally get some money after all that, and it
was usually a very small check. So the artists that were
actually continuing to be artists were the artists that were
making money; so it was, like, this level of superstardom
that was consistent and the barriers of entry were extremely
high.”</p>

<p class='c018'>That was true in all kinds of creative endeavors, especially
in writing. I myself was amused when lobbyists representing
industries such as music and publishing would
rant on and on about the need for “creative incentives.” If
business people at the megaconglomerates really understood
incentives, they would cut out their caviar, sell off
the executive jets, and spend more than a modicum on
garden-variety artists—not just the Mailers and
Madonnas. When, even as a teenager, Jeff Patterson
started asking where the money was going, he was laying
some of the more important underpinnings for IUMA.</p>

<p class='c018'>An “A” student who would later graduate near the top
of his class, Patterson wrote a school paper on another
major issue: censorship. Back in the 1980s, Tipper Gore,
Al’s wife, had helped start a group called the Parents Music
Resource Center, which wanted to rate music and keep the
more nefarious offerings out of the hands and CD players
of young people. “I was a big fan of Frank Zappa and he
was basically taking it upon himself to challenge the
PMRC.” The Senate held hearings. And Patterson recalled
that PMRC deemed a Zappa recording, “Jazz from Hell,” to
be sinful. The album lacked lyrics and the cover just
showed Zappa’s face. “It was obvious,” Patterson said of
Tipper’s group, “that they weren’t actually listening to the
content or caring what it was. They just kind of labeled
some artists as being bad, and therefore were trying to prevent
stores from selling many albums.” I asked if that
made Patterson think later on, “Let’s go on the Net so we
don’t have those bozos to worry about.” “Yeah, yeah. That
actually had a big part in it.”</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>From the start, it was clear that Patterson’s own music
wouldn’t exactly please the conventional. In high school
he played guitar in speed metal bands, which are “usually
a lot faster, a lot more angry sounding” than heavy metal.
When the Ugly Mugs found each other at William Hart
High, Patterson rejoiced in his friends’ weirdness. The
style in this case was Dada, a form of random art.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Who cared if anyone liked listening to it,” Patterson
said. “We just wanted to play it. We were using mainly
guitar and keyboards and bass. However, we wouldn’t always
play them in the normal standard ways. Like, we’d
use guitar for percussion or something, and we had also
used a vacuum cleaner and things like that. A lot of times
we just recorded sounds of things that were just laying
around.” Their big gig was at an interpretative dancing
class at a community college where teacher and students
loved Dada-style mime.</p>

<p class='c018'>The Ugly Mugs was a life, not just a band. Except for
an Egyptian guitarist, whose hair stubbornly kept turning
into an Afro when he let it grow, all the Mugs sported long
locks. In a dark, ratty, poster-ridden room, they would talk
politics and philosophy, standard teenage fashion.</p>

<p class='c018'>Lord ended up at the University of California at Santa
Cruz, and Patterson himself went on to the University of
California at Berkeley, where he studied computers, his
fallback field. He had made music on them in high school,
and, in fact, at Berkeley. “I started changing my major to
be a combination of music and computers. Two years into
it I really got frustrated with the high pressure and decided
to transfer to U.C. Santa Cruz. It’s right on the beach,
a laid-back community. Everyone drives, like, five miles
under the speed limit.” Beyond that, members of the Ugly
Mugs had moved there, and in Patterson’s opinion, the
school itself was “really great.”</p>

<p class='c018'>David Huffman taught there. In a certain niche
of computerdom, Huffman was famous as the creator of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>Huffman coding, a compression routine that software
products such as Stacker use to double the space available
on hard drives. Music isn’t exactly a low-bandwidth use of
the Net. Compression routines of one kind or another are
de <a id='corr94.5'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='riguer'>rigueur</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_94.5'><ins class='correction' title='riguer'>rigueur</ins></a></span> for the transmission of high-quality sound—not
just because of the space that the material <a id='corr94.6'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='require'>requires</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_94.6'><ins class='correction' title='require'>requires</ins></a></span>, but also
because big files take longer to transmit.</p>

<p class='c018'>At the time Patterson moved to Santa Cruz, he wasn’t
using Hoffman compression on the Net or posting CD-quality
sound from hundreds of musicians through an
IUMA-style operation. But like other techies, he was posting
files in the synthesized MIDI format. “The stuff I put
up there, it sounded like a bad Casio keyboard playing our
songs. It really wasn’t very representative at all. I’d just sit
there at my computer, compose ’em on the computer, and
upload ’em on the Net. I posted them to a couple of news
groups, like alt.binaries.sound and things like that and basically
got no response at all.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Jeff Patterson was reading the supermodel newsgroup
when he saw a posting from Rob Lord in favor of Kate
Moss, the model that so many of the regulars considered
too bony. Patterson replied. “We were both huge Kate Moss
fans.” Lord sent him some e-mail talking about how Kate
Moss should be the “queen of supermodels.” People on the
Net have a custom of leaving “signatures” at the bottom of
messages—places where they may post their address or
phone number, or an I-don’t-speak-for-IBM disclaimer, or
quote somebody to support them or deride them—and
Patterson took quick notice of Lord’s “.sig.” It alluded to
“MPEG Audio Compression, 16 to 1 CD Quality.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“And,” Patterson recalled, “I was like, ‘Wow, what’s
that?’ So I e-mailed him back talking about getting together
some Moss pictures, and in passing I asked him
about MPEG compression.” MPEG stood for Motion
Picture Expert Group—engineers who set standards for
audio and video compression. Growing curious, Patterson
downloaded software so he could play MPEG through his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>sound card. The results delighted him, and he spread the
news to the other Ugly Mugs. Hey, guys, Patterson said in
effect, what if we put our music on the Internet? “They
thought it was a pretty good idea. So we decided to chip in
together and go ahead and buy the software that we
needed to compress MPEG files, because you could get
that player for free, but the compressor cost $100. Rob
came over to my house, and I told him we were putting
our band on the Net, and he was all excited about the
whole idea of creating this archive of bands on the Net.“
But of course! Rave-think could reach cyberspace.</p>

<p class='c018'>Something was evident here, something obvious to
me, but perhaps not to all the bluenoses and prudish,
power-fixated bureaucrats. Patterson and Lord were proving
the old wisdom that hormones could drive technology
on the Net, or at least the applied variety.</p>

<p class='c018'>The wizardry of MPEG would be useless if people didn’t
use it. And it took a meeting of Patterson and Lord in
the supermodel group—not one devoted to Bible study, or
to paeans to Bill Clinton or Al Gore, or to the mandarins of
Singapore—for <a id='corr95.21'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='IMUA'>IUMA</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_95.21'><ins class='correction' title='IMUA'>IUMA</ins></a></span> to give MPEG one of its biggest
boosts on the Net. Why, horror of horrors, Patterson and
Lord just may have wanted to scan and swap <em>copyrighted</em>
photos of Kate Moss. One way or another MPEG would
become important on the Net, but thanks to people like
these two, it was happening far faster than it would have
otherwise. Technology was at odds with the vested interests
of record companies, and they knew it.</p>

<p class='c018'>At around the same time IUMA was getting under way
in fall 1993, lobbyists for the companies and performing
artists were fighting for laws that could lead to onerous
pay-per-listen schemes—while publishers were trying to
lay the basis for pay-per-read. Indeed, business people
and creators should receive fair compensation, especially
the creators; but in the zeal to protect major political contributors
from the entertainment industry, bureaucrats
and lawyers could imperil technology in the most lethal of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>ways. Bruce Lehman, Bill Clinton’s intellectual property
czar, would prove it later with a stunningly oppressive
proposal called the Green Paper, a technophobic lawyer’s
wetdream, a techie’s nightmare.</p>

<p class='c018'>The first song the Ugly Mugs put on the Net was called
”<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><em>Arbeit Macht Frei</em></span>”—German for “Work will make you
free.” A punky carnival song, it sparked an instant debate
on free speech.</p>

<p class='c018'>Asked about the title, Patterson told me, “It was kind of
born out of our frustration of, ‘In order to have the money
to do everything that we want to do, we have to work, but
if we work, we can’t do anything we want to do.’ So it was
kind of like commenting on people’s attitude of, ‘If you
work you’ll be able to do what you want to do,’ when actually
you won’t be able to do what you want to, because
you’ll be <a id='corr96.17'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='working.’'>working.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_96.17'><ins class='correction' title='working.’'>working.</ins></a></span> Actually it wasn’t a smart song title. It
was a phrase that was over the gate on the way to the
Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland. Unfortunately,
people took it to be this Nazi song, which is actually completely
the opposite of what we meant.</p>

<p class='c018'>“We got responses from people who flamed me because
they thought it was extremely cruel to be using this
as a name for a song and taking it all lighthearted when it
actually meant something serious to a lot of people.
Whenever anyone actually wrote to me, I usually sent
them back the lyrics and explained our stance, why it was
called that. It definitely created enough of a stir among the
few people who heard it. You wonder if a label would ever
take a chance with something like that.”</p>

<p class='c018'>On the Net, however, “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><em>Arbeit Macht Frei</em></span>” would find its
audience. A man from Turkey asked for a full demo
tape—unavailable—and more songs. Other Netfolks wrote
in from Texas, Florida, and elsewhere in the States, some
of whom said more or less: “You know, wow, I’m a Zappa
fan and I can hear the influence. It’s pretty cool.” The Net,
in character, was blurring distinctions between artists and
fans and helping the two groups mix. “We realized we had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>something,” Patterson told me. “Like, ‘Jeez, we got these
responses to a band that had never played anywhere and
didn’t have a tape out.’ So we started grabbing a couple of
our friends’ bands—like my roommate’s. And we put
Rob’s roommate’s band up there, and we just kind of kept
grabbing bands to put up. And slowly everyone was getting
one or two responses to what they had posted. And
we needed a place to actually keep all this music. There
were like four bands maybe at that time.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Patterson, however, quickly filled up all the disk space
available to him at his commercial Internet provider,
Netcom; so he and Lord contacted their university and
asked if they could store the music there. “Well, it turned
out that the guy who was in charge of running the FTP
site was a musician—he was in four bands—and he said,
‘Sure, go for it.’ And we put his four bands up there.”</p>

<p class='c018'>The technology would have seemed infuriatingly hard
to the world at large. You couldn’t just hook into the World
Wide Web, point and click your way to the IUMA archives,
and choose the song you wanted; no, you had to do FTP,
short for File Transfer Protocol, threading your way
through the big hard drives at Santa Cruz, until you
reached the subdirectory with the music. And then, with
most software, you had to type out the file names.
Patterson and Lord didn’t even start out with postings on
Gopher (which, to be grossly simplistic, is a more primitive
version of the Web).</p>

<p class='c018'>Even back then, however, the two were thinking about
the Net equivalent of album covers or of the J cards that
record companies used to tout cassettes. In other words
they didn’t just post files of sound alone. They also pondered
the use of files with pictures that music fans could
download.</p>

<p class='c018'>“At this point,” Patterson said, “it was still just a fun
project. We didn’t think about making it a money-making
venture at that point. We were just like, you know, ‘Let’s
put bands up and see what we can do to mess with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>record industry.’ We had this attitude like, ‘We’ll cut out
waste in the industry.’ At that time there was, like, no press
about us, so we weren’t really vocal, but we had those attitudes.
We were kind of like naive and rebellious.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Then an event happened that was almost as significant
to IUMA as was the discovery of MPEG. Lord discovered
the World Wide Web. “None of us,” Patterson
recalled, “had any clue what it was. I think it was in
December of ’93 that we got a hold of a copy of Mosaic.”
They tried it out in a faculty lounge at U.C. Santa Cruz.
“There wasn’t really much content on the Web at all. It
was pretty much, like, weather satellites. We realized from
that point on that we could really do something with taking
the music and the pictures and using the World Wide
Web as the way to present everything. People would be
able to look at the album cover, read the text, see ‘play’
buttons. You know, press the play button, hear the music,
and all that sort of thing.</p>

<p class='c018'>“So,” Patterson said, “we called up the guy we knew
from maintaining the FTP archives at U.C. Santa Cruz,
and asked him what he knew about the World Wide Web.”
Overnight he learned how to set IUMA up on the Web. His
name was Jon Luini, and he would become a partner in
IUMA, the co-czars’ “Kaiser.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Meanwhile IUMA’s popularity kept growing, and soon
the archives landed on SunSite UNC, a big digital library
sponsored by Sun Micro Systems at the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill. IUMA would even make it
to servers in Europe, so that people there could enjoy the
music without tying up the trans-Atlantic connections.
Other big companies, such as Silicon Graphics, took an
interest in IUMA and donated computers and other gear.</p>

<p class='c018'>But how were Patterson and Lord—and their musicians—going
to make money off the Internet, where “free”
was a religion and where commercial audio might be pirated?
I loved the many legitimately free pleasures of the
Net. It was truly for sharing. IUMA, of course, was offering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>lots of music at no charge. Via the World Wide Web, I myself
was giving away a book chapter I’d written for a forthcoming
information science collection; and I hoped that at
least some material from <cite>NetWorld!</cite> would be retrievable
without any money changing hands. But what to do about
the darker side of “free?”</p>

<p class='c018'>Sympathetic to the cash-short but clearly a realist,
Lord told how casually kids copied computer games for
each other. “There’s a complete underground going on,”
he said, and he told how young hackers had secretly
turned the IUMA archives into a site for stolen software.
The mischief was hard to spot just by doing the usual
check of the storage area.</p>

<p class='c018'>“We deleted their stuff,” Lord recalled, “and left a note
saying, ‘Leave us alone, you Rug Rats,’ because it was
clear there were 13-year-olds doing it. Some of the biggest
pirates in the world are younger than 15.”</p>

<p class='c018'>His words rang true. Adolescents in the States were no
match for the best pros abroad, but the teenaged pirates
could still be awesomely well organized. One group of
teens might crack the software. Another group might craft
a slick screen telling who had defeated the protection.
Lord told of a 13-year-old making $24,000 a year writing
and selling shareware; and although the business was legitimate,
this example showed the energy and brains out
there among the young—in other words, the difficulty of
fighting rip-offs.</p>

<p class='c018'>Lord and Patterson were thinking about releasing
IUMA offerings with digital identifiers that would make it
easier to track down thieves. And yet another tack could
be to design the music files that you could play only with
the right digital keys. IUMA’s owners were of GenNet;
they were more interested in relying on technology than
law to thwart pirates.</p>

<p class='c018'>Piracy is one reason why major record companies feel
uneasy about the Internet. Unable to ignore so large a market,
they want help in getting their message across to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>strange, young denizens. Warner paid IUMA to put short
samples of music online, along with pictures and information
about the artists. It was similar to what Patterson and
Lord were doing already.</p>

<p class='c018'>Now, however, like many others, the two were looking
ahead to new business models. Lord had a bunch of possibilities
in mind.</p>

<p class='c018'>One was that people would pay if they liked what they
heard, and maybe even give in advance. Another was that
they would receive little gifts——maybe clay cats?——for making
donations.</p>

<p class='c018'>Patterson, however, offered some models that were
more conventional. Gasp, his comments even sounded
like an actual business plan.</p>

<p class='c018'>First, he said, he and Lord would take orders for CDs
and tapes online for companies such as Tower Records.
Then IUMA would go the next step. It would sell files of
music electronically. Fans would be able to use Web
browsers like Netscape to encrypt credit card numbers so
hackers couldn’t intercept them. Eventually IUMA would
sell music for instant listening without customers first
having to transfer it to their hard disks. “There could be
some kind of royalty treatment,” Patterson said. “You
might pay two cents every time you listened to a song. Or
you could just buy an album.” Some good possibilities existed
here as long as no one gouged. If people could hear
music with just a tiny investment up front, that might benefit
new performers.</p>

<p class='c018'>More immediately, IUMA was helping fledgling musicians
and others by way of an informal support network.
Sue Few, a Santa Cruz woman who’d formerly worked for
record companies, went online with a newsletter called
<cite>Sound Check</cite> and offered a stream of tips on subjects such
as copyright law, musicians’ unions, royalties, and lining
up bookings. “Booking people aren’t so bad, are they?”
she wrote. “If they enjoy your tape and feel you’ll fit well
with their customers, you’ll get booked—simple as that.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>So they don’t return your telephone calls—keep calling
until you talk to a live person and still keep calling until
you get an answer and a date from them.”</p>

<p class='c018'>IUMA itself was a calling card of sorts. Record companies
and clubs could cruise the archives looking for bands
to sign up.</p>

<p class='c018'>Most important of all, however, IUMA helped potential
fans and musicians get together. At the time I toured
the IUMA area you could check out offerings by “Last 15
Bands” just uploaded to the archives, by artist, by label, by
location, and by song title. Or you could click on a database
with a number of options. I myself wanted to know
more about Scott Brookman, who had written “When I
Die You Can’t Have My Organs,” and who, as a result of
IUMA, had been on National Public Radio.</p>

<p class='c018'>A digitized photo showed him to be a bearded man
with glasses. Something white was against his face,
though I couldn’t quite discern the shape. I hoped it wasn’t
a stray from an anatomy lab.</p>

<p class='c018'>Messages on the screen said IUMA would let Netfolks
listen to Brookman’s “Organs” in stereo or mono. I clicked
on the latter option and watched the bottom of my screen
as it showed the number of bytes passing over the wires
from a computer in California to my 486DX-class machine.
Within 45 seconds I’d received a 119K file. In size it
was equivalent to maybe 60 double-spaced, typewritten
pages even though this was music not text.</p>

<p class='c018'>“When I die,” the lyrics wafted out of my stereo hooked
to the 486, “you can’t have my organs, though you think
that you will need them ...” If I’d had the right software on
my machine, I could have heard several minutes’ worth.
The song was good even if, with my primitive sound software,
it wasn’t even AM in audio quality. My rather untrained
ears picked up a Loudon Wainwright-ish edge to
the music. I made a mental note to myself. When I was off
my book deadline, I’d do what I should have done in the
first place and install the MPEG software whose existence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>had helped make IUMA possible. I had heard only a little
cut in another format With MPEG I could have enjoyed
three minutes’ worth, and in better fidelity.</p>

<p class='c018'>In the IUMA area Brookman said, “Organs” was
“from my latest cassette release, ‘They’ll Nickel and Dime
You to Death.’” He thought of his music “as a bizarre mix
of stylistic parody, satire, self-referential, and meta-songs,
full of clever guitar riffs and daring vocal harmonies. I
write about personal heroes, local history, teenage memories,
bits of folklore, and sometimes I make fun of rock
music (lovingly, of course). Usually the result is intentionally
funny ...”</p>

<p class='c018'>Brookman’s inevitable pitch for money was reasonable
enough. “I hope you enjoy the song, and I really think
you should get yourself a copy of ‘They’ll Nickel and Dime
You to Death.’ Send a check for five bucks (no charge
cards) made payable to Loser Records. That’s a full 60
minutes of awesome music for only $5. Where else, other
than a used record store, can you find that kind of entertainment
bargain? Here’s our address: Loser Records, P.O.
Box 14719, Richmond, Virginia 23221.” Hey, I’d already
enjoyed a bargain, his delightful little fan area. I would remember
the name Brookman.</p>

<p class='c018'>People could leave feedback and I brought up some.
“My colleagues and I agree—what a scream!!” read a note
from Virginia, where Brookman lived. “I think we’re going
to track down your CD. Congrats on a nifty tune! It’s good
to hear a local band ‘make it big.’” An Australian wrote in:
“Heheheheh. Nice sense of humour.” None other than Jon
Luini, Raiser of IUMA, said of “Organs”: “I cannot get this
song out of my head! The sincerity around this song is a
great combination with the odd nature of the lyrics, especially
when combined with the folk feel of the music. It
makes me feel like it should be included whenever people
first get their driver’s license.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Brookman’s electronic mail address was online, of
course, together with those of listeners who had offered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>feedback. Anyone wanting to start a fan list focused on
him would already have some names and e-mail addresses
handy.</p>

<p class='c018'>This was what the Net was so good for—not displaying
Canteresque spam on behalf of Green Cards or pitches
from CBS to join its fan club.</p>

<p class='c018'>Small business actually enjoyed an advantage here. To
CBS, fan mail must have been a nice a way of gauging the
market. But the Brookmans of this world could go far beyond
that and establish good rapport with fans, one by
one—something for which the people at the CBS site
would never have had time, given its volume. Small
worked in other ways for Brookman. He or Loser Records
(were they the same?) could do a short run of CDs and
spread the news with minimum investment. Pressing a
thousand CDs costs less than $2,000 nowadays. Combine
that with the Net, and the music world just might be a little
kinder to a young performer than it was in the days
when Lord and Patterson were toiling away in the record
stores back in Valencia.</p>

<p class='c018'>Granted, a place in the IUMA archives was hardly a
guarantee of success. A musician with the band Black
Watch told me that she and her colleagues normally
heard only from a fan or so a week. IUMA would <em>not</em>
make a band instantly rich. On the other hand, she loved
the feedback and encouragement that arrived from all
over the world; and, we both thought, wasn’t that important,
too—not just the money? The music was finding its
way to those who loved it. Besides, in the end, all the small
fry might add up. Lord said that instead of one Madonna
there might be fifty—“Maybe it will no longer make sense
to have even one.”<a id='r3.2' /><a href='#f3.2' class='c022'><sup>[3.2]</sup></a> Perhaps, I hoped, the money instead
would reach the Black Watches.</p>

<p class='c018'>Once Lord had predicted that in several years IUMA
might be “a one- or two-digit percentage of the $9 billion
music industry.”<a id='r3.3' /><a href='#f3.3' class='c022'><sup>[3.3]</sup></a> I didn’t know what would happen.
Major record companies would surely be doing plenty on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>their own. And when I talked to Lord in April 1995,
IUMA’s annual revenues were still in the low six figures.
But that could change, quickly. No matter what happened,
IUMA was brilliant for a niched world in which millions
were rebelling against the any-color-if-it’s-black mindset.</p>

<p class='c018'>We want just the right friends and spouse; the right
home; the right coffee; the right newsgroups, now that
they existed for all; and, yes, just the right music.</p>

<hr class='c032' />

<p class='c018'>The same nichization is happening in the world of
publishing—the Internet is home to hundreds if not thousands
of electronic publications. So what’s a hometown
paper to do? Just how is <cite>Time</cite> magazine responding? And
in such strange times—normal times, actually, once
they’ve been around long enough—what becomes of
books, especially when you consider the digital piracy
issue. In the next chapter I’ll lay out the problems and
even suggest a few solutions.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c017'>I ran across A. C. Snow on the Internet the other day, and
old memories poured forth.<a id='r4.1' /><a href='#f4.1' class='c022'><sup>[4.1]</sup></a> A.C. is as low tech as they
come. He writes a Tar Heelish column with jokes and
stories about church picnics and football and beach trips,
and yet there he was online with the folksy prose that I remembered
from eons ago. The <cite>Raleigh Times</cite> is gone now.
A.C. works instead for the bigger <cite>News &amp; Observer</cite>, a sister
newspaper that thudded against my dormitory door when
I was in college. Weekday circulation is around 150,000
nowadays, and many state legislators wake up each morning
to the <cite>N &amp; O</cite>—it just might be the most powerful paper
in North Carolina.</p>

<p class='c018'>Millions of people on the Net, however, would question
the need for the three-story tan brick building, the
fleet of delivery trucks, and the recent decision to invest
$36 million in color presses.</p>

<p class='c018'>You can’t update the ink on pulped trees the way you
can move around dots on a computer screen. “Aren’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>newspapers obsolete?” scads of techies are asking.
Besides, the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill area has
changed. Thousands of locals swap e-mail addresses at
cocktail parties, while many schoolchildren grow up
reading off computer screens as well as from books. IBM
and other Fortune 500 companies are in Research
Triangle Park outside town.</p>

<p class='c018'>Still, like the Raleigh area, the <cite>N &amp; O</cite> has evolved. In a
nearby building, a small crew is putting out electronic
newspapers on the Internet and on a bulletin board system.
This isn’t just a pulp-and-ink-era newspaper company.
It’s also an Internet provider. Aided by two phone
companies, the <cite>N &amp; O</cite> gives out free Internet service to
teachers and students to find out what the latter would
like online in the future. It’s offered Netfolks a colorful,
multimedia tour of the state. Tens of thousands drop by
the <cite>N &amp; O</cite> area each week. “The Internet is like the real
world—unorganized, unruly, and filled with more happenings
than any one person can possibly track,” says
Frank Daniels III, the paper’s executive editor. “It’s growing
at a fantastic speed, and its citizens are literate. An opportunity
for editors!”<a id='r4.2' /><a href='#f4.2' class='c022'><sup>[4.2]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c018'>Not everyone on the print side feels as he does. When
a <cite>Washington Post</cite> writer did a gossipy little item on Cliff
Stoll’s net.exposé, the journalist said book editors were
looking forward to reviewing <cite>Silicon Snake Oil</cite> as “confirmation
of what they hoped was true all along.”<a id='r4.3' /><a href='#f4.3' class='c022'><sup>[4.3]</sup></a> That may
or may not have been a joke. Whatever the case, a war is
going on between pulped wood and electrons. Can commercial
publications, from newspapers to book publishers,
learn to love the Internet, and what does this mean to
us readers?</p>

<p class='c018'>“There is no doubt in my mind that the Net will force a
transformation of newspapers,” says Peter Lewis, a cyberspace
writer for the <cite>New York Times</cite>, “but demise? That’s
what they said about radio and television as well.”<a id='r4.4' /><a href='#f4.4' class='c022'><sup>[4.4]</sup></a> Just
the same, a headline in <cite>Wired</cite> magazine said online newspapers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>“still suck.” Many newspapers are too enamored
with the traditional models where editors and writers inflict
whatever they want on the unsuspecting public. They
don’t give their readers enough of a chance to speak back
online or communicate with each other. Still, the best electronic
publications can indeed be two way. And more and
more of them will be packaged for the medium. You’ll be
able to read summaries of stories, for example, and then
summon up longer versions with a click of the mouse.</p>

<p class='c018'>Even ads may improve. “Think of the typical print tire
ad,” says Teresa Martin, an online expert with the Knight-Ridder
newspaper chain. “<em>Yawn.</em> But what if touching each
tire bought up detailed specs about it, or the sizes in which
the store currently has it in stock—or even some really
cool car careening around a racetrack with the voice-over
‘speed rated?’ The ad can be like a window to a store, enticing
the reader in to look for information.”</p>

<p class='c018'>I know—computers are too hard for many technophobes
to learn, too big to use in bed, and often too blurry
or flickery to read off of; and batteries are forever eager
for their next charge. But life will get better. It will happen
faster if governments worry less about smartening
up TV sets and more about smartening up schoolchildren
with programs that drive down the cost of book-friendly
computers. Much, however, is already going on. Xerox,
for example, has experimented with a computer screen
whose output is as sharp as printing on paper. It’s a
power hog, but less hungry screens are coming. Writing
in <cite>Digital Media</cite>, Martin says the right hardware could be
a mere six years away.<a id='r4.5' /><a href='#f4.5' class='c022'><sup>[4.5]</sup></a> I myself think—based on my
monitoring of technical publications—that her estimate
is conservative.</p>

<p class='c018'>Besides, even now, electronic texts can at least complement
the paper kind. For example, they can increase the
variety of newspapers, books, and magazines available.
After U.S. Senator Jesse Helms joked that Bill Clinton
would need a bodyguard to protect him from angry service
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>people who resented his military policies, I did not rely
just on the <cite>Washington Post</cite> for details. I called up the story
directly from the <cite>News &amp; Observer</cite> hundreds of miles away.
What’s more, it’s easy to wander from one electronic publication
to others when you are after facts on the same topic,
or to search back issues of newspapers and magazines.
Even novelists are discovering the possibilities of the new
media. Readers can choose their own endings or pass on
suggestions to the authors of works in progress.</p>

<p class='c018'>Adventurous media people are trying to adapt to this
online world as gracefully as they can, and the Internet is
oh so enticing to many. The cost of the technology has
fallen to the point where a bare-bones newspaper can go
on the World Wide Web by investing as little as
$5,000-$10,000 up front. Publishers needn’t divvy up revenue
with a commercial online service, such as America
Online or CompuServe.</p>

<p class='c018'>Compared to pulped wood, the Net looks better and
better—the price of paper shot up some 30 percent between
the fall of 1994 and the spring of 1995. Environmental
regulators are forcing the pulp mills to quit
sullying the air and the water, and new mills can cost half
a billion dollars each to build. “Like the rest of us,” writes
Jonathan Seybold, publisher of <cite>Digital Media</cite>, “the paper
company executives read all of the press stuff about the
Information Highway, the rise of online services, and the
decline of paper-based publishing.” And he says they are
now asking, “Why should we invest in a new paper mill?”
The result? Newsprint shortages and higher prices. “The
fear,” Seybold says, “creates its own reality.”<a id='r4.6' /><a href='#f4.6' class='c022'><sup>[4.6]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c018'>More than 100 newspapers either are on the Internet or
are planning to be there. The <cite>New York Times</cite>, for example,
has used the World Wide Web to transmit a fax edition condensed
from the normal paper. A full-grown <cite>Times</cite> may be
on the Net now. The <cite>San Jose Mercury News</cite> in California
not only is online, it offers a service called News Hound. For
just $10 a month, the Hound will automatically scan a massive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>database from Knight-Ridder papers and additional
dailies, then e-mail you the latest articles on the cover girls
of <cite>Sports Illustrated</cite>, on Afghanistan, on the Chicago Bears,
on Bill Clinton, or on any other topic that quickens your
pulse or makes you reach for your Valium. From the
<cite>Halifax Daily News</cite> to Poland’s <span lang="pl" xml:lang="pl"><cite>Gazeta Wyborcza</cite></span>, newspapers
are trying the Net. Even a strike paper, published by
reporters of the San Francisco <cite>Examiner</cite> and <cite>Chronicle</cite>,
made it into cyberspace.</p>

<p class='c018'>Some Netfolks preferred the strike daily to the electronic
spin-offs of the regular ones, and I wasn’t surprised.
What applies to business applies to newspapers:
The Net is a great equalizer in some ways; a small newspaper
can reach as far-flung a readership as an international
daily. In fact, the first paper on the World Wide
Web just might have been the <cite>Palo Alto Weekly</cite> from
Silicon Valley. South Africa’s <cite>Mail &amp; Guardian</cite>, a 30,000-circulation
weekly, finds the Internet a much cheaper
way to reach people overseas than air-mail. Devoted to
Russian news, the <cite>St. Petersburg Press</cite> uses the Internet to
serve an English-speaking audience throughout the
world. The <cite>London Telegraph</cite> has shown up on the Net
with some striking graphics. No longer is the Internet just
for little magazines published by techies and smart young
English majors.</p>

<p class='c018'>Time Warner has put <cite>Time</cite>, <cite>People</cite>, <cite>Entertainment
Weekly</cite>, and a shelf full of other magazines in a colorful,
well-done area of the World Wide Web. Readers can
praise and flame the editors and each other. Hearst magazines
have their own area. <cite>PC Magazine</cite>, one of the
giants of the Ziff-Davis chain, enraged many Netfolks
with clueless articles suggesting a rather thorough ignorance
of the Internet and its reasons for existence. But
guess what. Now Ziff-Davis has a wonderful Web area
with generous samples from its magazines, including <cite>PC</cite>.
The German newsmagazine <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Der Spiegel</cite></span> is on the World
Wide Web, too, complete with some news in English;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>from Japan, specialized publications serve Net audiences
ranging from gays to office workers.</p>

<p class='c018'>I learned of the most dramatic use of cyberspace by a
magazine just as I was finishing this book. <cite>Omni</cite>, the popular
science publication, said it would forsake monthly
paper editions in favor of a version on America Online,
augmented by just four print editions, one each quarter. It
expected to save some $4 million a year. The newsletter
<cite>Interactive Week Publishing Alert</cite> raised some valid questions—copies
of back articles from <cite>Omni</cite> were too hard to
locate—but even if the grand experiment failed, the model
was out there. A major publication was more or less forsaking
pulped wood in favor of computer networks.</p>

<p class='c018'>Book publishers are catching up with newspapers and
magazines. Time Warner, Random House, Macmillan, and
McGraw-Hill use the Internet for promotion, and they will
distribute more and more of their books this way. Free classics
like <cite>A Tale of Two Cities</cite> have been a staple of the Net
for years, thanks to voluntary efforts such as Project
Gutenberg. And now you can pay a few dollars to download
a short story by Stephen King or works by many others.</p>

<p class='c018'>Meanwhile, however, some old-fogey publishers view
the Internet as an unfathomable virus transmitted via
cable. That’s especially true of the book business. People
in it fear a massive bootlegging of their wares. Using the
Net, you can even pirate paper books; there is no technical
reason why machines cannot scan the latest from Philip
Roth or Tom Clancy, convert their novels to bits and bytes,
and zap them to your friends in Juneau. Software-based
copy protection could help safeguard electronic books.
But I myself think there are other solutions as well—for
example, a national library fund to make free or low-cost
books practical and reduce the incentive for bootlegging.</p>

<p class='c018'>Paper publishers also complain that if electronic
books are cheaper to create and distribute, manuscripts
will receive less editing. With a good library system in effect,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>however, a way would exist to highlight works of
merit—marketers would enjoy less clout and we’d see
fewer best-sellers on astrology and more on history. And
without the distribution costs, more money could go to
writers and editors.</p>

<p class='c018'>Other obstacles also exist in the minds of publishers
eyeing the Internet. Some worry about finding a market
for text offered through a global network. And certain
people in the book industry also dread the competition
from the many gigabytes of free material that the
Internet offers. Didn’t Samuel Johnson know best?—No
one but a blockhead ever wrote except for money. If
nothing else, many word people are captives of their
senses. They hate reading off computer screens; they
want to hear a newspaper thunk against their doors,
hold Section A in their hands, hear it rattle, sniff the ink.</p>

<p class='c018'>Going in the other direction, many people on the
Internet love to bash the print world as benighted and
even a little worthless. Who needs publishers when you
can post your own books and little magazines for the
world to read on the Net? That’s simplistic in many cases;
I’ve got a little more faith in the editors at Knopf or Viking
than I do in the proofreading gang from the Department of
Chemistry or Joe’s Literary Bar.</p>

<p class='c018'>People on the Net, however, are right to criticize the
print media’s ignorance of electronic publishing and
computer networks. If nothing else, many traditional
publishers fail to grasp the potential here. Looking at the
old, underpowered machines that clutter their offices,
they may believe that computers won’t progress from
there. An intelligent staffer with a publishers group—someone
I respected on other matters—didn’t understand
the promise of computers for reading e-books. I
shared this story with Robin Peek of Simmons College,
who coedited a book on electronic publishing for the
American Society for Information Science and the M.I.T.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>Press. She told me that many book publishers just hoped
that computers wouldn’t improve until the publishers
died or retired. Computers keep stubbornly getting better,
though; blurry screens and fragile hard disks won’t always
be the order of day.</p>

<p class='c018'>More amazingly, a popular magazine misinformed
some of us Netfolks that we were “netgods.” Didn’t our
Internet addresses end with a prestigious “.net” rather
than “.com” (the designation for a commercial site) or
“.edu” (for a school site)? Strange. Anyone can pay $14 a
month to ClarkNet or many other services and automatically
get an address like rothman@clark.net. So much for
my godliness.</p>

<p class='c018'>Zeuslike, however, I’ll hurl thunderbolts at HarperCollins
and Doubleday. The former published the book
that the immigration lawyers in Arizona used to justify the
off-topic ads that they had inflicted on thousands of newsgroups.
The Canter and Siegel guide was in the same class
as astrology books. It talked about spending just $.0333
per thousand users per month to reach 30 million people
on the Net. Most of the people, however, can only use e-mail
and aren’t on Usenet or the Web. Doubleday erred in
other ways. It let Cliff Stoll smear cyberspace as “devoid of
warmth and human kindness.” Devoid? A rather all-encompassing
word. In both cases the paper publishers
were entering an unknown world.</p>

<p class='c018'>To give another example, a <cite>New Yorker</cite> article lamented
the destruction of library catalogues without
really telling how electronic libraries could do the job better.
The article went on about the handwritten annotations
on the cards, and I could see the point here. Couldn’t
a card for a Civil War book include an informal recommendation
for a book on Antietam or Gettysburg? Must all
cross-references be official? So I could appreciate writer
Nicholson Baker’s worry about the fate of those beautiful
wooden cabinets. What he played down, however, is that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>technology can let electronic librarians create quick paths
from one work to another.<a id='r4.7' /><a href='#f4.7' class='c022'><sup>[4.7]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c018'>Far from being exotic nowadays, this technology is the
essence of the World Wide Web. So if you looked up a general
item on the Civil War, you might see some annotated
references to an item on Antietam, and go there instantly
with a click of the mouse.</p>

<p class='c018'>Just as wrongly, an article in the <cite>Atlantic Monthly</cite> of
September 1994 said future electronic books could perish
because they used many disk formats. “The End of the
Book?” asked the headline over T. J. Max’s doomsaying.
But CD-ROMs and books on floppy disk are just transitions.
Unless legislators interfere in the most ham-handed
of ways, computer networks should be the natural homes
for electronic books. They could reach us more cheaply,
and in greater varieties, without the bottleneck of physical
bookstores. So disk standards should be just plain irrelevant
in the end. The true raison d’etre for the Internet is its
ability to let many kinds of machines share information
without the least worry about floppies or magnetic tape.
<a id='corr113.21'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Must'>Most</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_113.21'><ins class='correction' title='Must'>Most</ins></a></span> of the time I don’t know if my no-name IBM clone is
talking to a Mac or a $5-million mainframe. Besides, we
mustn’t preserve books just physically; in a videocentric
era we also need to help them survive in the minds of
readers, particularly those outside the elite. We should
spread books far and wide, then, and make the technology
as friendly to words as possible.</p>

<p class='c018'>But tell that to Max. In his eagerness to put down electronic
text, Max depicted the <em>print</em> version of <cite>Wired</cite> magazine
as hypocritical. He wrote:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c018'><em>Although</em> Wired <em>communicates extensively by e-mail
with its readers, conducts forums, and makes back
issues available on-line, its much-repeated goal of
creating a magazine—currently called</em> HotWired—<em>that
is especially designed to exist electronically
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>remains fuzzy. For the moment this is no open
democracy, and</em> Wired <em>is no computer screen—its
bright graphics would make a fashion magazine envious</em>.
Wired <em>celebrates what doesn’t yet exist by exploiting
a format that does: it’s as if a scribe copied
out a manuscript extolling the beauty that would
one day be print</em>.</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>Strange. Just what’s so odd about using old technology
to spread word of alternatives, especially the dazzling
e-magazines that already enliven the Web? When Nicholas
Negroponte published <cite>Being Digital</cite> (New York: Knopf,
1995), a bestselling collection of his lively <cite>Wired</cite> essays,
some Generation Xers bought it not for themselves but for
their parents—which was exactly what Negroponte wanted.</p>

<p class='c018'>Max is especially off target about <cite>HotWired</cite>. Today,
just months after he wrote of the publishers’ “fuzzy” goal,
the magazine is one of the most successful on the Net with
far more than 100,000 readers. It makes massive use of
hyperlinks—the technology I described by way of the Civil
War example. Within discussion areas, readers can create
links from their posts to text, pictures, and sound elsewhere
in the World Wide Web, including their own electronic
pages—they needn’t confine themselves to tiny
letters to the editor. Simply put, <cite>HotWired</cite> both praises and
exemplifies the new medium.</p>

<p class='c018'>I couldn’t care less, moreover, if this electronic magazine
runs long articles that have come out in print or
could have—just so <cite>HotWired</cite> also gives me new material.
Not everyone on the Internet reads the printed <cite>Wired</cite>. One
of joys of the Net, moreover, is the ability to offer greater
levels of detail for those wanting it. What a grouch Max is.
He might as well be a monk lecturing Gutenberg about
the glories of calligraphy.</p>

<p class='c018'>Even <cite>PC Magazine</cite>, one of my favorites, at times can
be all wet about the Internet and related topics. A columnist
suggested that most people on the Net be forced to pay
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>for each letter sent out; supposedly, Netfolks were too
quick to e-mail each other. Excuse me. Such an approach
could kill off many of the mailing lists through which academics
and nonacademics swap ideas and research notes
en masse. A very small fee based on actual costs and Net
congestion? Maybe. But not one designed to minimize
use. To the columnist, however, the Net’s role as a petri
dish may count less than its promise as a corporate
mailman. He misses a major point. The Internet is one of
the planet’s cheapest ways to transmit knowledge, including
the kind that might cure cancer or give us a 150-mpg
automobile. While commerce on the Net is laudable, we
need those mailing lists as well—and not just for professors
but public schools, libraries, charities, psychological
support groups, and activists of all ideologies, to name just
a few of the better examples. The economics of the Net
will make this possible, especially as bandwidths increase
to accommodate greater use of audio and video—text just
won’t cost that much. Alas, the columnist in this instance
failed to understand the Internet and its possibilities.</p>

<p class='c018'>I myself won’t claim omniscience about the Net. Once I
saw a message on a mailing list from someone pushing for
a huge National Knowledge Foundation to benefit educators,
librarians, journalists, and investigators. The post
mentioned international topics, among others, and flares
went off in my head. I posted some sharply critical, journalistic
questions, wondering if the post had come from a CIA
type. Some people on the list cheered me on while I pressed
for public answers. It turned out that the post <em>was</em> from a
former Company man, and as I persisted in querying
Robert David Steele about his funding and motives, he sent
me a colorfully worded note that might have made a Paris
Island drill instructor envious. I quoted his e-mail, as I
would have done if writing this up for a magazine. What a
way to justify my fears of the intelligence establishment
playing too powerful a role in determining the content of
material online. I remembered the valuable exposés that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>the press had done of the CIA years ago; we need to separate
U.S. journalists from spies, lest impartiality of the news
media suffer. This debate I would win.</p>

<p class='c018'>But I didn’t. In fact, I suffered a major debacle; flame
after flame from bystanders assailed <em>me</em>. Even though I
told Robert Steele I wanted public answers, people felt that
I had violated the traditional prohibition against quoting
private posts in public, at least with names attached. Some
of the bluntest Anglo-Saxonisms came from luminaries on
the Internet. People wanted perfect freedom to speak their
minds in messages deemed private, just as professors and
students in class would want to be free to say outrageous
things without ending up on the front pages of the local
paper. I, on the other hand, had applied journalistic expectations
to the Net. A reporter might end up with a better
story if a celebrity exploded during an interview and this
fact came out in print. But on the Internet, the freedom to
be outrageous in private mattered more than the freedom
to quote, even with advanced warning. Yes, I had questions
about this custom. What if people took advantage of this
Netiquette to engage in sexual or racial abuse, or just
abuse, period? Should rules really be hard and fast? Just
the same, in Net terms, I was the loser here because I wore
my Writer Hat at the wrong time.</p>

<p class='c018'>Luckily the story ended happily. Robert Steele and I,
while disagreeing, made our peace. I went to one of his
conferences and shook his hand. Later I happily discovered
that he shared my hatred of the Clipper chip, the
loathsome White House scheme to make it easier to snoop
on citizens’ communications. He was far more openminded
than I’d originally expected. Even without that
consideration, however, a feud just didn’t make sense
here. Canter and Siegel may claim you can reach 30 million
people in one swoop, but as I say repeatedly, the Net
is a <em>series</em> of communities, some of them rather small-townish.
Within our somewhat overlapping circles, it
would have been mutually harmful for Robert Steele and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>me to squander time and reputations on a protracted
flame war.</p>

<p class='c018'>Other kinds of clashes take place between Internet culture
and that of traditional media types; in the eyes of
many people on the Net, print people are not the only villains.
<cite>Dateline NBC</cite> ran a story about children using computer
connections to locate recipes for making bombs. The
children, however, could have done the same at bookstores
or public libraries. <cite>Dateline</cite>’s episode reminded one
Netizen of the time NBC secretly used a hidden ignition
system to show that an automobile could explode. Just as
bizarrely, in print and on the air, some journalists love stories
about the Internet as a playground for child molesters.
If we on the Net were a religious or ethnic group, we could
start an antidefamation league and keep it forever busy.</p>

<p class='c018'>By Net standards, the media bumble in yet other ways.
If you’re a newspaper or magazine journalist, you may
have been reared to neuter yourself about The News; no
opinions online, please. On the Net, however, many people
are suspicious if you do <em>not</em> join the crowd and speak
out. They dislike net-thropologists; that is, media people
and others who study the Net rather than contribute to it.
Among some journalists the standard modus operandi is
to post questions for an article, then vanish without sharing
anything with the Netfolks.</p>

<p class='c018'>Happily, this is changing somewhat. In fact, you can
find a few journalists from the <cite>New York Times</cite>, <cite>Wall Street
Journal</cite>, <cite>Washington Post</cite>, and other major papers speaking
up online about matters dear to them. Recently a reader
flamed the <cite>Post</cite> for its Internet coverage (“what those idiots
at the <cite>Post</cite> write isn’t worth minimum wage”). Alluding to
software that can screen out messages from offensive people,
reporter John Schwartz punched right back: “It’s bozo
filter time.” He had been using online services for years,
and here, it showed. The old stereotype, in which all members
of the major media are clueless, just doesn’t fly any
more. Not too long ago somebody shared a <cite>New York Times</cite>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>article—discussing some other people’s proposal for a national
digital library—with hundreds of a members of a list
devoted to law in cyberspace. He did not ask permission
from the <cite>Times</cite>. A pithy reference to copyright law then emanated
from none other than Peter Lewis, who had written
the article and was a regular on the list.</p>

<p class='c018'>So how are Netfolks treating Lewis nowadays? He
e-mailed back an answer in prose worthy of a discussion
group on the Internet itself:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c018'><em>It took me a while to get used to being flamed by
pencil-dicked geeks who hide behind their terminals,
saying things I’m sure they’d never dream of saying
to my face. But now I’ve become something of a connoisseur
of flamage, and while I regret that it is
widespread on the Net, I regret more that the quality
of flaming is almost uniformly weak. I now savor
good flames and ignore the rest. On the other hand,
it took me almost as long to get used to having instant
feedback, often pointed and critical and right-on,
to my writing. While there is a danger of a
“chilling effect” from flamage, perhaps subtly influencing
reporters to back off a subject in anticipation
of a flood of “Dear Clueless” letters, I think the overall
benefit of instant and widespread reader feedback
is a Good Thing. Perhaps all rookie reporters
should be required to write a Net story just to let
them know that they do not write in a vacuum,
whether their beat is the Internet or the police station
or sports.</em></p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>Like the police beat, the Internet comes with its set of
rules—as my experience with the CIA alum vividly
showed. Some on the Net attach a statement to every post
saying it’s copyrighted. Others just worry that the wrong
set of people may read and quote their more outspoken
messages. Lewis considers list and newsgroup posts to be
public: “My mother once advised me, long before she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>knew I would be a journalist, ‘Never put anything on
paper that you wouldn’t want to see on the front page of
the <cite>New York Times</cite>.’”</p>

<p class='c018'>Still, Lewis normally catches up with the writers of
posts he plans to quote. “However, the reason has more to
do with verification than with netiquette. In cyberland as
well as in the real world, as you know, the fact that someone’s
name and address appear in a letter does not guarantee
the identity of the writer.” Lewis reminded me that
“half a century ago some newspapers forbade reporters
from quoting sources contacted by telephone on the same
rationale: How do you really know that was Mr. Doe on
the phone if you didn’t see him? In cyberville, not only can
we not see our sources, but neither can we hear them.”
And then a few sentences later came the electronic signature,
“Pete (at least, you <em>think</em> it’s Pete) Lewis.”<a id='r4.8' /><a href='#f4.8' class='c022'><sup>[4.8]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c018'>Other challenges exist online. When reporters use e-mail
for interviews, they take away the element of surprise—often
the surest route to the best answer. “Also,” says Jordan Green,
a Canadian freelancer who relies heavily on e-mail, “there is
no body language or voice intonation in e-mail. We do have
our various symbols to >>>highlight&lt;&lt;&lt; and _emphasize_
WORDS and feelings :-) but there is far more which cannot
be picked up.”</p>

<p class='c018'>In the end, however, computer networks will make
the press better informed, not worse. Via Lycos, for example,
a searching tool on the Web, I can track down files
written by just the right person to interview or find background
information that someone archived from the relevant
newsgroup. Besides, who says that all interviews are
confrontational? Often e-mail is just right, and I can always
use the telephone to fill in gaps. “I used to ask, ‘What’s your
fax number?’ at the end of a phone interview,” says a magazine
writer named Peggy Noonan.<a id='r4.9' /><a href='#f4.9' class='c022'><sup>[4.9]</sup></a> “Now I also ask,
‘What’s your e-mail address’ because it’s often much faster
to post a question or send a draft for approval via e-mail
than by another means.” Some journalists might object to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>showing drafts to sources. But Noonan clearly sees the networks
as a godsend for other purposes as well.</p>

<p class='c018'>Another believer is Arik Hesseldahl, a young reporter
with the <cite>Idaho State Journal</cite> in Pocatello who, like many
journalists of his generation, grew accustomed to the
technology in college. “Remember that flesh-eating bug
scare a few months ago?” he said. “I got in touch with a
doctor in England who debunked all the rumors and
media hype, which is what it was—hype. Just today I am
looking for an expert on nuclear fuel reprocessing equipment
who is untainted by the Department of Energy and
the rest of the federal nuke bureaucracy. Already I’ve gotten
five suggestions for experts.”</p>

<p class='c018'>I myself see other advantages for people in the pulped-wood
world; via the Net I don’t just approach editors—I
hear from them out of the blue when they like my postings.
Other freelancers have also benefited. Steven Sander
Ross, a professor at Columbia University, uses the Net to
communicate with European magazines that pay better
than those in the States. Just as the Net creates global
markets for florists and sellers of teddy bears, it multiplies
opportunities for the best writers. That is true for newspaper
and magazine writers now and will be increasingly
true for authors of books. Mind you, there is a downside,
too. The Net may actually <em>hurt</em> the worst writers as they
face more competition, whether from professionals across
the planet or from the free material that Netfolks share
with each other.</p>

<p class='c018'>Here are three case histories that should be of interest
to writers, editors, publishers, and the rest of the
cosmos:</p>
<p class='c033'>• Case History 1. The <cite>News &amp; Observer</cite> has used the
Internet not only to reach the denizens but also to get existing
readers and advertisers on the Net. In an era when
so many greedsters hope to charge outrageous fees to
consumers for online information, the <cite>N &amp; O</cite> is hoping
that ads will pay much or even most of the freight.</p>
<p class='c025'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>• Case History 2. Time Warner, as noted, is putting magazines
and book excerpts on the Internet, and it’s doing so
in ways befitting the medium. Many of the same concepts
carry over from online newspapers, which is why
this section and the next will be much shorter than Case
History 1. In fact, so far, an <cite>N &amp; O</cite>-style business model
seems to be influencing Time at least somewhat.</p>
<p class='c025'>• Case History 3. Laura Fillmore runs an online bookstore
that not only sells books but <em>gives them away</em> on the
Internet. She even used the Net to promote a pulped-wood
book that has sold hundreds of thousands of
copies. Fillmore’s ideas are significant because she is
working hard to reconcile publishers’ needs with those
of society at large, and I commend one of her business
models as an alternative to pay-per-read gouges. The ultimate
answer, in my own opinion, is a national digital
library and a program to drive down the cost of book-friendly
hardware. Using this approach—a mix of editorial
and technical wizardry to add to the value of plain
text—good publishers would flourish. Readers and writers
would come out ahead, too.</p>
<p class='c024'>Finally, I’ll offer an update on the <cite>N &amp; O</cite> and other publications
on the Internet. When Frank Daniels described
the Net as “unorganized” and “unruly,” he might also have
been talking about certain trends in his own industry. A
surprising twist unfolded in the story of the <cite>N &amp; O</cite>.</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>More than two decades ago in a scuffy-floored room at
the University of North Carolina, not that far from the
<cite>N &amp; O</cite>, I heard Professor Walter Spearman expound on the
prickly question of uppity letters to the editor. What if a
reader taunted, “You’ll never print this?” The crux of Walt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>Spearman’s wisdom was this: <em>Don’t go for the bait. If you
don’t want to print it, don’t.</em><a id='r4.10' /><a href='#f4.10' class='c022'><sup>[4.10]</sup></a> He was teaching me to be, in
modern parlance, a “gatekeeper”—to decide which news
and opinions made it into print and which didn’t. Only so
many column inches existed on the editorial page, and we
journalists were to watch over this space as if it were the
Mona Lisa. Without the slightest apology, we should tell
the public what to read, and besides lording over the editorial
pages, we should inflict the same front page stories
on everyone. The notion that each reader could write regularly
for other readers, or that he or she could see wire
service stories online, was as sacrilegious as it was science
fiction-like.</p>

<p class='c018'>By the end of the 1970s, however, at Duke, UNC, and
N.C. State, hackers were paving the way for Usenet, a series
of discussion areas on the Internet and on bulletin
board systems that let <em>everyone</em> have a say—from Nazis to
Maoists. Together with talk radio and with other forms of
computer communications, Usenet could help Americans
bypass the gatekeepers. Readers wouldn’t see on their
screens an appealing combination of headlines and Times
Roman type. But no blue pencils would be around to
scratch out the heresies of nonjournalists.</p>

<p class='c018'>Usenet in the end wouldn’t just carry alt.activism or
comp.general or alt.sex; it would also be home to a nice
little electronic newspaper called ClariNet, which in 1995
enjoyed 100,000-plus readers, and which each day let
readers choose from among hundreds of dispatches from
Reuters, the Associated Press, and more specialized services.
My friend Jim Besser covered Washington for a
string of Jewish newspapers. He could dial up ClariNet,
other sections of Usenet, and the Internet at large and see
material that might take days and days to wend its way
into the <cite>Washington Post</cite>, assuming it ever got there at all.
Usenet in the end was more of a wire service than a newspaper;
that just may have been its real triumph. Some old
print people hated ClariNet, seeing it as a threat to their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>gatekeeping. For a while, ClariNet sent out the columns of
Dave Barry, the quirky but popular humorist enjoyed by
thousands of Netheads. Then, however, his syndicate
pulled him off the service. Illegal copies had wafted all
over the Internet, and the bootlegging had surely outraged
client newspapers—the main reason; but a second, minor
one may have existed as well—the hostility between the
Net and many members of the print media.</p>

<p class='c018'>The Internet was partly why Michael Crichton, the author
of the novel <cite>Jurassic Park</cite>, could shrug off newspapers
and some other mass media as “tomorrow’s fossil fuel.”
The Cable News Network and radio talk shows are not the
only threats to the hegemony of the old-time gatekeepers.
So are the Internet, CompuServe, America Online, GEnie,
Delphi, and, of course, the more than 50,000 bulletin board
systems run by hobbyists and others. “Newspapers,” wrote
the media critic Jon Katz, “have been foundering for
decades, their readers aging, their revenues declining,
their circulations sinking, their sense of mission fragmented
in a world where the fate of presidents is slugged
out on MTV, <cite>Donahue</cite>, and <cite>Larry King Live</cite>.”</p>

<p class='c018'>I was fascinated, then, to learn that the old <cite>News &amp;
Observer</cite> was on the Net now. Was the <cite>N &amp; O</cite> serving readers
better? With the above in mind I spent several <a id='corr123.24'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='week'>weeks</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_123.24'><ins class='correction' title='week'>weeks</ins></a></span>
talking to the Raleigh people on the phone and via e-mail,
and studying the electronic versions of the newspaper,
both the free samples on the Net and the version for paying
customers.</p>

<p class='c018'>My conclusions were positive, though not entirely.
Katz, the author of the “Still Suck” article in <cite>Wired</cite>, would
have disliked some aspects of the <cite>N &amp; O</cite>’s electronic efforts.
<cite>Wired</cite> had asked, “How can an industry which regularly
pulls Doonesbury strips for being too controversial possibly
hope to survive online?” And, sure enough, if you were
on the Internet by way of the <cite>N &amp; O</cite>’s service in fall 1994,
you couldn’t subscribe to the alt.sex string of newsgroups.
Moreover, unlike the <cite>Time</cite> areas online, the <cite>N &amp; O</cite>’s BBS
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>had not sprouted hundreds of messages from free-spirited
readers and editors. Truly controversial postings were
rare. And yet the editors were clearly moving away from
the traditional gatekeeping role. Meanwhile, the <cite>N &amp; O</cite>
was enriching the Internet by way of well-written news
stories and features—many available for free. Flaws aside,
this was a fine example of how the print media could befriend
the Net and the young people who favored computer
screens over pulped wood.</p>

<p class='c018'>Frank Daniels III, the executive editor, tinkered with
computers himself in high school two decades ago, and as
early as the late 1980s he was using Macs to shuffle
around stories on the pages of a magazine that his family
owned in Charlotte, North Carolina. Working with a stock
analyst, Daniels created a computerized database of the
top fifty companies in the Charlotte area, and that, in turn,
led to a newsletter. So early on, Daniels saw how high tech
could spawn lucrative opportunities. He also saw the negatives.
The owners of the <cite>Los Angeles Times</cite>, Knight-Ridder,
and other organizations were experimenting with
Videotext, which allowed news stories to scroll across
television screens.</p>

<p class='c018'>Such endeavors were brave. They were also premature.
Videotext at the time cost the customers too much,
and just as the Prodigy service would err later on in the
same way, the newspapers failed to appreciate the fondness
of many customers for typing to each other. Reading
news stories and shopping from home weren’t enough.</p>

<p class='c018'>Many U.S. dailies would go on to flounder even on
pulped wood. Whether Americans were watching video-cassettes
or hang gliding, millions had other uses for their
time, especially baby boomers. Some 60 percent of the
households in Wake County had once subscribed to the
<cite>N &amp; O</cite>; by the late 1980s, just 40 percent did. Newspapers
kissed off much of the market, jacked up their prices, and
began seeing themselves as a way for advertisers to reach
at least the Oldsmobile set if not the BMW set. And yet,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>even by those criteria, the <cite>N &amp; O</cite> was a slacker. Back then,
as it does today, the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill area
boasted one of the highest concentrations of Ph.D.s in the
country. Some 40 percent of the households now own
computers, more than 10 percent can go online, and the
average home price is well on the way to equaling that of
some major metropolitan areas. Even five years ago, and
long before, high tech was enriching the Research
Triangle.</p>

<p class='c018'>But would the <cite>N &amp; O</cite> adapt to this new market, a
harbinger for many other areas in the United States and
elsewhere? Frank Daniels saw the newspaper as a change-proof
antique, and he was ready to dump his <cite>N &amp; O</cite> stock
and sink the money into an online service.</p>

<p class='c018'>Then Daniels got some journalistic religion at a newspaper
seminar, the secular equivalent of a good Baptist
soaking. To hear him tell it, he suddenly understood that
“the relationship between a newspaper and a community
has such a richness and history that communities
shouldn’t lose that.” And he felt that online services could
take advantage of those relationships with readers and
advertisers. Today the <cite>N &amp; O</cite> goes by this philosophy, not
entirely but to a great extent. Readers can e-mail many of
their favorite writers, while long-time advertisers can buy
<em>X</em> number of column inches in the paper editions and receive
exposure in the electronic editions.</p>

<p class='c018'>Something else, however, may have bound Frank
Daniels to his paper as well—old family stories and the
memories they stirred. The first Daniels landed in North
Carolina several hundred years ago, and the family reunions
continue to this day. Frank III’s great-grandfather,
Josephus Daniels, purchased the <cite>N &amp; O</cite> at a bankruptcy
auction in 1894. He carried on as one of the state’s more
colorful and outspoken publishers, with a strong populist
streak, and took time off in Washington to serve as secretary
of the Navy under Woodrow Wilson. I ran across
Josephus on the Internet, just as serendipitously as I had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>found A. C. Snow. Through the American Memory Project
at the Library of Congress, I could <em>hear</em> Josephus honor two
naval heroes with a speech called “There Is No Rank in
Sacrifice.” I passed on word of my discovery to Bruce
Siceloff, an online editor, and he played another Daniels’
speech for the clan while showing off the paper’s marvels of
technology. Frank Jr., publisher of the <cite>N &amp; O</cite>, tapped the
arm of a cousin who had just walked into the room. “That’s
your grandfather,” he said as the spooky old wax recording
crackled away in its new electronic incarnation.<a id='r4.11' /><a href='#f4.11' class='c022'><sup>[4.11]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c018'>Josephus, though his racial views softened, reflected
the separatism of many Carolinians in the first half of the
twentieth century. The paper itself changed. It eventually
hired Claude Sitton, a Pulitzer winner notable for his civil
rights reporting in his days with the <cite>New York Times</cite>. The
<cite>N &amp; O</cite> in some ways became the <cite>Times South</cite>. Reporters
fought racial injustices. Frank III portrayed the paper of
that era as never having met a cause it didn’t like. What’s
more, he said the <cite>N &amp; O</cite>, although exposing politicians on
the take, was too quick to editorialize for local programs
that raised local tax rates. I myself favored the crusading
kind of newspaper—in fact, one risk of a high-tech orientation
was that it could turn a newspaper into an uncritical
cheerleader for business if editors were not careful—but I
could understand Daniels’ concern over government
spending. At any rate some felt that the <cite>N &amp; O</cite> was losing
touch with many readers, and so Frank Jr. and the others
on the board of directors agreed to let Frank III serve as
executive editor in the wake of Sitton’s retirement.</p>

<p class='c018'>The contrast between the old and new editors couldn’t
have been more stark. Sitton was a formal man who insisted
that his reporters wear suits and ties. Frank III relaxed
the dress code. In place of a sign with his editorial
title, he stuck up one that said simply, “Frat Man.” Old-timers
groaned that this young Duke alum lacked enough
journalistic experience. The man had been the newspaper’s
<em>operations manager</em>. Wasn’t it apparent? For each
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>year of experience on the State side of newspapering, you
could subtract two years of experience with the Church.</p>

<p class='c018'>Even under Sitton, the reporters typed away on a modern
publishing system for newspapers. But that was more
or less all they did—write. Many could just as well have
been pounding away on old Smith Coronas. They hadn’t
any desire to learn the technology, not when there were
doors to knock on, vote counts to check, political corruption
to chronicle, Ku Klux Klan rallies to report, and courthouse
records to search the old-fashioned way. Young
Daniels set to work changing all that, and with the most
surpassing of allies. The news librarians almost instantly
grasped the potential of computerized databases. So did
Pat Stith, the senior investigative reporter. The <cite>N &amp; O</cite>
would go on to collect state records showing traffic or
hunting violations, or others, and then seek out patterns.
“We analyzed all the speeding tickets,” said Daniels, “and
found out what percentage of tickets were given at each
mile-per-hour level. It turns out that if you go 63 miles per
hour in a 55-mile-per-hour zone, you have less than a 1
percent chance of getting a ticket.” Via the same quantitative
techniques, the <cite>N &amp; O</cite> could evaluate the programs of
local government. By the time Daniels had effected his
transformation, he had squeezed dozens of personal computers
into an already-crowded newsroom.</p>

<p class='c018'>A year or so after Frank Daniels III became executive
editor, he first beheld the Internet over at North Carolina
State. “An engineering student said, ‘Have you seen this?’
and he showed me Usenet. And about forty-five minutes
later, while I was thirty minutes late for a meeting, I was
speechless. I walked out. I was just buzzing with the possibilities.”
Daniels saw some engineering newsgroups
and, yes, some sexually related ones. “I couldn’t believe
how many people I saw talking together, just following
each other’s conversations. The letters to the editor at the
time were the only connection the <cite>News &amp; Observer</cite> had
with its readers.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>“Our business is connecting people. Here was a whole
world that existed without our knowledge. It was a small
world and an elitist world, but it confirmed my earlier belief
that computers were going to be ubiquitous.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Effortlessly Daniels understood that Usenet wasn’t
Videotext—people <em>wanted</em> you to talk back. So the Internet
was at least on his mind as a possibility for the time when
the numbers were right. Daniels for the moment pushed
into less exotic areas; for example, he started a useful,
lively, but expensive fax newsletter for the elite, <cite>The
Insider</cite>, which covered North Carolina politics with a
commitment to detail missing from the daily press. The
<cite>N &amp; O</cite> also offered sophisticated research services, using
the databases it was amassing. And the paper let readers
dial up stories over the telephone through a technology
known as Audiotext.</p>

<p class='c018'>The electronic action, however, really took off after
Daniels hired George Schlukbier, a computer-oriented librarian
who had worked wonders at the <cite>Sacramento Bee</cite>.
Like Daniels the frat boy, Schlukbier flaunted a few eccentricities
within bounds. An electronic signature at the bottom
of his Internet messages identified him as “Chief Bull
Goose Looney,” a tribute to the giant Indian who terrorized
Nurse Ratched in <cite>One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest</cite>,
the Ken Kesey novel. Some, of course, might argue that the
Internet is itself a virtual asylum with the inmates in
charge.</p>

<p class='c018'>Schlukbier and Daniels checked out Prodigy and
America Online to see about getting on those networks
and decided that the numbers stank. Yes, Prodigy-style
services already had their networks in place, and the <cite>Los
Angeles Times</cite> and papers in George, New York and elsewhere
would go on to sign up. But the <cite>N &amp; O</cite> concluded—rightly,
in my opinion—that the online services would
need the newspapers more than the newspapers would
need the online services. Newspapers were the best
source of steady, detailed news about local communities.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>Each year the <cite>N &amp; O</cite> spent $12 million covering mainly
local and state news, an amount that even a giant like
Prodigy could not replicate everywhere. “They’ve got their
view of the world that’s defined by whatever technology
they adopted at the time they started their service,”
Daniels would later say. “We got uncomfortable with the
fact we’d be living their rules, and the customers would be
their customers.”<a id='r4.12' /><a href='#f4.12' class='c022'><sup>[4.12]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c018'>Some other newspapers felt happy with Prodigy. “No,”
said Mike Gordon, an editor with Cox Newspapers in
Atlanta, “Prodigy isn’t taking most of the money.” What’s
more, his online edition could enjoy revenue from online
ads. Still, more and more publishers were turning to the
Internet rather than Prodigy-type alternatives, and the
balance of power changed. When Microsoft started a new
online service later, it offered newspapers as much as 80
percent of revenue—at least several times the amount that
Prodigy had offered the <cite>N &amp; O</cite>. (The Atlanta papers would
themselves end up on the Internet eventually, not just on
Prodigy.)</p>

<p class='c018'>Instead of relying on a Prodigy-style service, Schlukbier
started a locally oriented BBS with an Internet connection
and a strong emphasis on schoolchildren, not just the
adult readers of today. This orientation may have baffled
many. Some newspaper publishers were too myopic to see
past the next quarter, especially if they worked for the big
chains. Exceptions did exist, of course. Knight-Ridder, for
example, regardless of its public ownership and its
Videotext flop, was still pouring millions into the new
technology. As a family-owned newspaper, however, without
security analysts breathing down its corporate neck,
the <cite>N &amp; O</cite> was especially free to experiment. Schlukbier
believed that a decade would pass before 40 or 50 percent
of the homes in Raleigh were online, and by then the children
would be of customer age.</p>

<p class='c018'>“By focusing on third-graders,” Schlukbier said, “I’ve
got ten years to learn from them what information they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>really need and want.”<a id='r4.13' /><a href='#f4.13' class='c022'><sup>[4.13]</sup></a> What they hoped for, in many
ways, didn’t seem like a newspaper at all. Rather they
wanted their own tools. The bulletin board blossomed
with imaginary worlds in which, for example, Frank
Daniels was the owner of a fictitious newsstand. Children
could wend their ways through cyberspace by using written
descriptions and computer commands to tell where
they were and what they were doing. George Schlukbier’s
young son, Shane, designed a mythical camp online with
danger-ridden woods. Some may have wondered how this
applied to <em>newspapers</em>; I myself did. And then it dawned: if
newspapers would be increasingly two-way in the future,
just like the Net, then didn’t it make sense to see how the
children interacted with each other, as they did in role-playing
games? The children could change as they grew
older, or moved away from the area when their parents
packed up for another job with IBM, but the journalists
could still observe the basic patterns.</p>

<p class='c018'>The <cite>N &amp; O</cite> put more than 6,000 children and 700 teachers
online for free. NandOLand was the name of the educational
service designed with children in mind; a mouse
click on a cloud, for example, would take children to a
NASA area on the Net. The students could send electronic
mail to each other or type to each other instantly. “I have
seen children who never cared what they wrote turn to a
dictionary rather than send a letter to a key pal with misspelled
words,” said a teacher named Stephanie Toney. “I
have seen a child with a severe reading disability sit for
hours and concentrate on e-mail to another person on the
other side of the world. His English teacher would have
given her right arm to interest him in reading and writing
for this period of time.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Granted, NandOLand wasn’t the entire solution to the
needs of children. Many couldn’t spend much time on a
machine at school and lacked one at home. But the program
was much better than the alternative: expensive
school connections to the Net or no Internet at all.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>Like the children, the <cite>N &amp; O</cite> itself was learning—about
the local schools and other institutions and the Net itself.
“How many newspaper editors and reporters get to talk
with students, parents, and teachers any time they want to
without making a big deal of it?” asked Daniels.<a id='r4.14' /><a href='#f4.14' class='c022'><sup>[4.14]</sup></a> And so
the educational coverage was better. Rosalind Resnick,
publisher of <cite>Interactive Publishing Alert</cite>, wrote that the
<cite>N &amp; O</cite> was “at the head of the pack when it comes to promoting
interactivity between its readers and reporters.”
By the summer of 1995 every staff member, including
those in circulation and advertising, would be able to go
on the Net from their desks. Daniels’ own Net address
showed up on the paper’s editorial page each day. The
<cite>N &amp; O</cite> was publishing a dozen or two Internet items each
month, complete with a column called “Net Rider.” How
different the paper was from a rival in nearby Durham:
“We don’t print many Internet stories,” a staffer there said
when I asked to speak to whoever covered the Net. The
words were spoken almost in a way to suggest that
“Internet” was synonymous with “<cite>N &amp; O</cite>.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Not everyone was happy with the <cite>N &amp; O</cite>’s Internet service.
Around 700 people had subscribed commercially by
fall 1994, paying $20 a month, and some rightly complained
about the look and feel of the BBS and the busy
phone lines they had encountered during the summer.
When I posted a query on the Internet, at least half of the
replies were hostile to the online <cite>N &amp; O</cite>. Some showed a
knee-jerk hatred because they disagreed with the paper’s
politics. But others were right on target. The BBS incarnation
of NandO.Net, the name for the commercial part of
the online endeavors, was more of a rutted dirt road than
an eight-lane information highway. Customers for some
months had trouble dialing up the service’s modems for
want of enough phone lines. Other glitches arose. The service
prided itself on the ability to whip people back and
forth between the local board and the Internet-related services
without any effort. And yet in making the transitions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>customers suffered delays and software glitches that they
might not encounter with a more polished service.
Schoolchildren and BBS junkies were the best kinds of
people to enjoy the wild ride and the scenery.</p>

<p class='c018'>The online <cite>N &amp; O</cite> responded with some technical improvements;
the paper added many more phone lines and
gave customers the ability to use Mosaic to point and click
their way through the Web. Mosaic had a much smoother
feel than the BBS software. By late 1994 the <cite>N &amp; O</cite> was offering
the public an electronic newspaper and the Internet
at the competitive rate of $20 a month while helping to
subsidize the educational side. And it was serving people
with different levels of equipment. The BBS was designed
to work especially well with less powerful machines and
snailish modems that were far too slow for Mosaic.</p>

<p class='c018'>On the Net, the people who answered my queries had
another major complaint—the inability of NandO.Net to
make alt.sex-style groups conveniently available. Frank
Daniels made no apologies. However liberal towns like
Chapel Hill might be, the state as a whole was of the opposite
bent. And that included more than a few church-goers
in Raleigh. “The community standards of our
community don’t mix with some of the sexual parts of
Usenet,” Daniels said, “so we edit them out.” In addition,
most subscribers were children. “I have a seven year
old,” he said, “and I don’t want him delving into
alt.sex.bestiality or those other places.” Many of the
Netheads would have said that one person’s “editing”
was another’s “censorship.” I myself, however, understood
Daniel’s worries. At least two other Net services
were available in the same area, so it wasn’t as if he were
gatekeeping for the entire town; what’s more, he said
that when the software allowed, the sex-related newsgroups
would be available as an option. Just the same,
the issue epitomized the clash between the gatekeeping
ethos and that of the Internet.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>More serious than the lack of alt.sex, to my mind, was
Daniels’ failure to appreciate sufficiently the political freedom
of Usenet, the same service that had attracted him to
the Internet in the first place. I complained to him that his
own BBS included far, far less in the way of political discussion
than I’d have wanted, and I contrasted this to the
robust debates of Usenet. “To be honest, David,” he said, “I
think one of the least useful pieces of the Internet so far is
their political discussions. They’re not very good ones.
There’s a lot of flaming. The political discussions aren’t
very productive. I follow mainly the local ones here.
These people discuss national issues and never have a
policymaker looking in there. So why discuss it if it isn’t
going to have an impact on policy?”</p>

<p class='c018'>While Daniels was worlds ahead of newspaper editors
at large, he was showing the vestiges of the gatekeeping
mindset that the new technology had made obsolete. I myself
disliked unmitigated flaming. And yet there were times
when harsh words were called for. The <cite>N &amp; O</cite> didn’t wimp
out when the editorial board attacked the Ku Klux Klan or
the more outrageous statements of Jesse Helms, the right-wing
senator. Why should people online be any different?
And although it might be nice for a policymaker to read
my public messages as soon as I sent them out—and, yes, I
could recall hearing out of the blue from the White House
after one such posting—that was hardly necessary. Democracy
isn’t just a citizen writing to a congressman. It is
also citizens communicating with citizens, educating,
proselytizing; and with the economies of Usenet, more citizens
could reach their peers for greater enlightenment.
And then, if a consensus were reached, political action
might ensue, such as letters to Congress. So why must
politicians be involved from Day One? Daniels was out of
touch here, and I hoped he’d catch on.</p>

<p class='c018'>Admittedly NandO.Netters could hook up with the
Usenet political areas, even if the <cite>N &amp; O</cite> played them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>down; but the newspaper didn’t really promote political
debates on the BBS itself. And it was not just because
Daniels believed that the readers disliked flaming and extremism—it
was also because he felt that real, live politicians
were not ready for online appearances yet. “When
we can get commitment from the politicians and policymakers,
then we’ll make a push at it. But not until it becomes
something where our community can have really
productive discussions. I don’t want to train them not to
like them. What happens is that the people on the Net are
trained not to like them. Extremists and flamers love
them.” I supposed there were a lot of us undesirables,
however; for alt.activism and similar areas were among
the more popular newsgroups on the Net—no match for
alt.sex, but certainly not small time.</p>

<p class='c018'>If Daniels had had a complete set of Net values, he
would have understood the benefits of debate online, and
not just the political action but the <em>education</em>. I myself was
liberal. And yet when discussing information policy, I
could learn at times from the most zealous of Libertarians
and Objectivists. Some were among the most advanced of
the technologists. In fact, their technical backgrounds may
have led to their hatred of regulation—they loathed the
bureaucrats who could not fathom the direction in which
computers and communications were headed.</p>

<p class='c018'>To his credit, Daniels at least was not calling for censorship
of Usenet; he was merely saying that he wanted
his own service to be different. What’s more, technology
and marketing forces, the great deciders of cyberspace,
might change his mind for him.</p>

<p class='c018'>Just as he had assumed in the first place, people on
the Net wanted to <em>talk</em>—not just to the <cite>N &amp; O</cite> but to each
other about all kinds of topics, including material in the
paper itself. And the more comfortable the readers grew
with the online world, the more spirited, the more Usenet-like,
would be the discussions. No, the meek would not
suddenly turn into flamers. But the thrill of technology
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>would be less of a distraction, and they would pay more
heed to what they had to say and grow more adventurous
about it. On the <cite>N &amp; O</cite>’s present BBS, with its often
awkward commands, many people were not even leaving
messages for each other. Instead they typically used the
system at a more primitive level to type out their thoughts
with the other person online at the same time. I hated this
approach. It brought to mind Dave Barry’s crack that the
Internet was like CB radio with typing.</p>

<p class='c018'>Even if Daniels still did not enjoy the political debates
on the Net itself, he was living up to the old tradition of
sharing material with the rest of the world. In that sense
his newspaper was exemplary. The <cite>N &amp; O</cite> didn’t just offer
news, discussion areas, and games for its subscribers:
Sample news and features were free to anyone who
wanted to read them. That was how I’d first run across
A.C. Snow. I’d seen the <cite>N &amp; O</cite>’s name on a list of newspapers,
and A.C. had caught my eye as I was wandering
through the Gopher that stored sample news stories and
columns from the paper. The World Wide Web, however,
was the best way to try out the electronic <cite>N &amp; O</cite>. When I
dialed up the main page for NandO.Net, I could see a colorful,
bluish logo and enjoy a newsstandish atmosphere,
with scads of goodies to explore. The <cite>N &amp; O</cite> differed from
many electronic newspapers. It didn’t just inflict on readers
a digest of generic news, with only the most cursory
helping of original material.</p>

<p class='c018'>I read samples from the regular <cite>N &amp; O</cite> and specialized
publications such as the <cite>Insider</cite>; enjoyed brief but
regularly updated electronic news intended for the Net
itself; wandered through a little bookstore with cover
shots from books by Snow and other columnists; wended
my way through tens of thousands of words from a journalism
seminar at Harvard; soaked up long, multimedia
features; dialed up samples of rock music; and ventured
into the sports area—the <cite>N &amp; O</cite>’s most popular material
on the Web.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>The sports area was the baby of a bearded, forty-something
editor named Eric Harris who had turned into
a Nethead, and who like Schlukbier came with a nickname:
“Zonker.” A child, seeing the beard and taking in
the personality, had compared him to the Doonesbury
character. That was a little unfair. Zonker of the comics is
a goof-off, while Zonker of the Net is a workaholic whose
messages might bear 4 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> time stamps. Harris is
Webmaster—the man with the daily responsibility for the
content of the Web area in general—but his true love was
sports. He packed the server with game schedules. During
the ’94 baseball strike the <cite>N &amp; O</cite> indulged fans with
whimsy such as “Cybersox Take the World Series”—reportage
of mythical games. “Need something to do
while we wait for the owners and players to resolve their
differences?” the Web area asked on another electronic
page. “Well, the Baseball Server is doing its part. Download
the above images, tack them onto the wall, and buy a set of
darts. Then, every time you feel a twinge of baseball withdrawal,
grab a dart, think a ‘warm’ thought about one of
the participants, and let the fun begin.” And sure enough,
Netfolks could print out pictures of the villains, each of
whom had a superimposed picture of a dartboard and the
wonderful caption: “The only losers are the fans.”</p>

<p class='c018'>The <cite>N &amp; O</cite> also shared with the Net a variety of other
material, of which my favorite was North Carolina
Discoveries. A lively feature writer named Julie Ann
Powers sought out offbeat places. In Lake Norman, for example,
she found that “houses and hangars ring the
airstrip and each lot comes with a grass taxiway to the
paved and lighted runway.” In Orient, a hamburger-and-hot-dog
cook named Red Lee claimed that at twenty-five
cents each, his offerings were the cheapest in the country.
And in Tryon, the publishers of the <cite>Daily Bulletin</cite> said that
at 8 by 11 inches, their newspaper might be the smallest
in the world. Powers drove from town to town in a Ford
Explorer that she had nicknamed Barlowe after Arthur
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>Barlowe—one of the first Europeans to behold the state of
North Carolina. Barlowe was a gadgeteer’s heaven on
wheels, full of audio and video equipment. People on the
Web didn’t just enjoy gloriously descriptive stories from
Powers: with Mosaic-style software they could <em>see</em> a picture
of her wearing a sun hat on a beach or gaze at sand
dunes or waterfalls or whatever she happened to be writing
about at the time. If they owned a sound card, they
could <em>hear</em>, too. She walked around carrying a microphone
so large that it resembled a folded-up umbrella.</p>

<p class='c018'>Powers might well be one of the first multimedia reporters
to work for a Net-oriented daily newspaper. I
asked her to share a few trade secrets. She said she interviewed
people twice. The first time she gathered the basics
for her regular story; the second time they spoke
while tape rolled. Powers said she never knew which
sounds would work out and which wouldn’t. A recording
of a glorious waterfall ended up sounding like a toilet
flushing.</p>

<p class='c018'>I asked about the challenge of balancing her traditional
duties as a reporter with those as an audio-oriented
interviewer. Some old hands in the <cite>N &amp; O</cite> newsroom saw
the gadgetry as a threat. It was all too remindful of the days
when computers were replacing typewriters in the newsroom,
and many reporters and editors balked at being
typesetters. But Powers turned the new technology to her
advantage. The microphone and electronic camera—a
photographer followed her around—made her more
aware of her surroundings and sensitive to new story angles.
Once she did a story on Ten Commandment
Mountain. It was part of a Biblical theme park, a peak in
western North Carolina with God’s words spelled out in
“concrete letters each measuring five feet high and four
feet wide.” A roar from a giant lawn mower kept drowning
out the voice of the man she was interviewing. “They always
ask,” he volunteered, “how do you mow that mountain?”
Presto, she had the magic quote to use near the lead.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>“A special mower with a low center of gravity,” she revealed,
“tilts and leans up and down the steep planes.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Whether reading about twenty-five-cent hamburgers
or godly peaks, I could scoot easily between pictures and
words. The <cite>N &amp; O</cite> had a “North Carolina Discoveries” logo
at the top of one page, a picture of Powers in the same
area, and then a list of the Discoveries stories that she had
done. By clicking my mouse on a list of story headlines in
blue letters, I could immediately go to the stories. When I
chose “Home Sweet Hangar,” I sped to the same headline
atop a color photo of an aviation buff inspecting “his
Cessna 172 after rolling it out of the hangar at his house in
Lake Norman Airpark.” Yes, the caption was there too.
And then I saw the story lead with an apt quote (“It’s like
being an avid golfer and living on the golf course”) followed
by a list of other items. I could choose “Audio:
Talking about life on the flight line” if I wanted to hear an
interview. What’s more, if I’d set up my software, I could
even have picked “Video” and gone on to a list of short
movies. I also saw background items such as a list of
“Triangle-area flight schools” and “FAA regulations: How
to get your pilot’s license.” The beauty of this arrangement
was that the <cite>N &amp; O</cite> could provide all kinds of wonderful
details for the interested without inflicting them on others.
Unless they mouse-clicked the appropriate words in blue
letters (or whatever the special color), they would never
see the material.</p>

<p class='c018'>The <cite>N &amp; O</cite> used the same approach on news stories.
When North Carolina was about to gas a man named
David Lawson, readers could click on the item “The
Lawson Execution.” They could see a schedule of the
events ahead—from Lawson’s removal from his cell to the
EKG examination that would help certify his death. After
the Associated Press reported the execution, readers could
click on a headline and read the details. They could even
summon up “Preparing for the execution” or “How the
gas chamber works.”</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>The Lawson story was a just a sample—the <cite>N &amp; O</cite> at
the time wasn’t constantly doing multimedia on breaking
news—but it was easy to envision the future for American
newspapers using the Web. Imagine the blessings for
journalists who wanted to write on neat little odds and
ends without getting in the way of their main articles.
They could merely add “links” to offshoot stories. Perhaps
the reader could even click and summon up a collateral
audio report or even a video. At first it might be hard to do
all this on deadline, but links would be a cinch as software
improved. What’s more, newspaper writers might evolve
into true personalities just like their counterparts on television.
After all, if a reporter’s byline were in blue letters,
you could click your mouse to see a photo and maybe
even a bio featuring credentials—you could find out, for
example, if the legal reporter held a law degree. You could
also quickly locate copies of earlier work or a list of his or
her favorite books.</p>

<p class='c018'>Granted, electronic newspapers posed new challenges.
Not all stories lent themselves to multimedia, for
example. What if newspapers played down those that
didn’t? “If you tried to do that with a lot of news stories,”
Julie Powers told me, “you would end up serving the video
masters rather than the news functions.” Still, in the end,
the reader would enjoy far more choices than before.</p>

<p class='c018'>The Web, as I saw it, held out yet other possibilities for
local papers such as the <cite>N &amp; O</cite>. Suppose you lived in Chapel
Hill and wanted to see what news had happened there in the
past 24 hours; you could click on a map of the Raleigh area
and behold a story list from your town. Neighborhood-level
submaps could show still more. You could read the most
minor tidbits—for example, new requests for zoning
changes or items from neighborhood newsletters. Even
more helpful, you could find old stories and other background
information. Let’s say you were shopping for a
condo on a certain street. You might think the neighborhood
was safe—Chapel Hill is a university town, remember—but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>learn that many crimes had occurred nearby. Furthermore,
you could adjust the <em>kind</em> of information that you summoned
from the Web. For example, you could see lists of
houses for sale in a neighborhood and then retrieve their
photos along with audio sales presentations. Moving on to
another information category, you could uncover lists of
nearby stores or see test scores from the closest elementary
school. And you might even see ads from nearby restaurants
and click on them to order.</p>

<p class='c018'>The food-related examples weren’t entirely hypothetical;
Zonker Harris pointed me toward me some mock ads
from Hardee’s and a chain called Little Caesar’s Pizza. The
same business principles I discussed in chapter 2 applied
here. Rather than planning to inflict vast quantities of material
on the unwilling, the <cite>N &amp; O</cite> made the ads useful and
entertaining. Elsewhere in the <cite>N &amp; O</cite> area I saw an ad for a
computer dealer, among others, but the real triumph was
the area from Mammoth Records—with home pages for
bands, promo photos, discographies, tour dates, album covers,
and more, including a catalogue and, yes, free samples.</p>

<p class='c018'>But what about the economics of all this? Via an electronic
edition the <cite>N &amp; O</cite> wouldn’t collect the fifty cents it
charged per hard copy issue, but it wouldn’t have to buy
newsprint and distribution services. <em>That</em> was how
George Schlukbier hoped the newspaper would turn a
profit eventually. The electronic activities, although not
yet profitable as a whole, were coming along. People on
the Net, for example, were calling up the pages within the
<cite>N &amp; O</cite>’s area several hundred thousand times a week. A
page was what you saw when you clicked the mouse to
call up an item, and each page could be just a few lines of
information, or go on for a number of screens. Zonker
Harris expected that by the end of 1994 as many people
would be dialing up the <cite>N &amp; O</cite> as called up SunSite UNC,
the popular collection of files at the University of North
Carolina. Readers retrieved Mammoth Record’s pages
some 35,000 times a week. That didn’t mean 35,000 people—there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>was plenty of repeat business, and of course
the same people looked at more than one page—but the
numbers looked good as a start.</p>

<p class='c018'>Just who, however, was reading the Web areas of the
<cite>N &amp; O</cite> and other Internet publications? The <cite>Washington
Post</cite> and many other dailies had chosen to avoid the Net
for the moment because they thought that the right people
weren’t there. And some marketers and journalists tried
to reinforce such arguments by citing a study of 4,777 Web
readers by researchers at the Georgia Institute of
Technology. Ninety-four percent were men, and 56 percent
were 21-30 years old—almost half were students or
faculty members or had other university ties. “These are
hardly the type of people to make large consumer or business
purchases,” a <cite>San Francisco Chronicle</cite> story observed.
The experience of JoAnn and Bob Lilienfeld, as
recounted in chapter 2, showed that riches would not automatically
come to merchants on the Web. And yet the
potential was there. The Web readers uncovered by the institute
weren’t charity cases—just yups. Studying the
readers of the Baseball server, the <cite>N &amp; O</cite> found they were
a long way from poverty. Twenty percent of these Netfolks,
for example, earned $35,000-$50,000 a year, 18 percent
earned $50,000-$75,000, and 4 percent earned more than
$75,000. And, of course, many of these Netfolks were
young people who would carry their Net habit over to
their jobs and their personal lives. Not surprisingly,
Schlukbier claimed keen interest from representatives of
companies such as J.C. Penney and Radio Shack, and, of
course, from fast-food chains, which, in so many cases,
targeted their ads at the young.</p>

<p class='c018'>Cleverly the <cite>N &amp; O</cite> built on existing relationships with
advertisers. If you were already on the paper and bought
<em>X</em> number of lines, then you could get the Net as a bonus.
North Carolina businesses paid as little as $50 a month in
basic fees to be in the <cite>N &amp; O</cite>’s area on the Net, not including
add-ons such as design services. Big national firms
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>would pay well into the thousands. Given the newness of
the medium, this would scare off many—unless, like the
<cite>N &amp; O</cite> itself, they saw the Net as an investment in the future.
Then the experiment might work. In my mind, however,
there was one other variable: What about <em>national</em>
publications competing with local papers for the same <em>national</em>
advertisers? Already Time Warner and the <cite>N &amp; O</cite>
were watching each other carefully.</p>

<div class='textbox1 width:45%'>

<p class='c018'>Magazines: Time Warner</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>Typing away on Macintoshes on the fortieth floor of
the Time Life Building in Manhattan, ten floors above
<cite>People</cite> magazine, a small team started an area of the Web
known as Pathfinder. It offered electronic versions of Time
Warner’s vast stable of magazines. Zonker Harris at the
<cite>N &amp; O</cite> had a slogan, “May the best server win.” The
Durham newspapers might not be in the game so far, but
<cite>Time</cite> and brethren were.</p>

<p class='c018'>Zonker was justifiably proud of the 300,000 or so accesses
a week that the <cite>N &amp; O</cite>’s Web area was enjoying
after several months on the Web. But just within a week of
start-up in fall 1994, the Time Warner area was drawing
more than 80,000 accesses a <em>day</em>. That didn’t mean that
the <cite>N &amp; O</cite>’s efforts were doomed—hardly. But despite all
the talk about the Net being nirvana for smaller companies,
Fortune 500 corporations arrived with some advantages
of their own. Once readers grew comfortable with a
certain area of the Web, they might spend less time on
other parts of the Net. This wasn’t so much a pattern at the
time, but as mass audiences descended on the Net, corporate
logos might count far more. Beyond that, Time
Warner already offered a daily version of <cite>Time</cite>—a <em>newspaper</em>
in effect. It was just one service among a rackfull of
publications. Readers could read up on foreign policy or
the latest <cite>Star Trek</cite> film in <cite>Time</cite>, take in reviews from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span><cite>Entertainment Weekly</cite>, keep up with Ice-T and other hip-hop
musicians in <cite>Vibe</cite>, or fire off questions to authors of
best-sellers from Warner Books.</p>

<p class='c018'>An even greater threat to the <cite>N &amp; O</cite>, in the long run,
was the fact that Time Warner didn’t just own magazines
and book publishers. It also owned <em>pipes</em>, including a
cable operation in the Raleigh area. And someday it might
use cable TV lines to send the Net into homes there, competing
with the <cite>N &amp; O</cite>, which had already been providing
Internet services. If no antitrust or other legal boundaries
existed, then Time Warner would be remiss in its duties to
its <a id='corr143.12'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='stockholder'>stockholders</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_143.12'><ins class='correction' title='stockholder'>stockholders</ins></a></span> if it did not explore this route. Think what
this would mean to users of the World Wide Web. If an article
came with fancy photos, they might have to wait several
minutes for the whole works to reach them at a
speed of 14.4 kilobits per second. But suppose Time
Warner used cable TV to bring the Internet to them.
Their televisions would still work with cable the usual
way. But their computers could share the cable and retrieve
Web articles and other material in a fraction of the
time. Cable modems sold for hundreds of dollars. But
pilot projects were going on with other companies, and
the cost could soon drop to a fraction of that amount.
More important, big, well-financed corporations might
be willing to modify the old cable for these new capabilities.<a id='r4.15' /><a href='#f4.15' class='c022'><sup>[4.15]</sup></a>
What did this mean for local, <cite>N &amp; O</cite>-sized companies?
Just as high tech had blurred the difference
between telephones and televisions, the Net itself was
blurring the barriers between local and national. It was
unclear whether the public would win or lose.</p>

<p class='c018'>For better or worse, Time Warner’s area on the Net was
part of an evolution in cyberspace. The process had begun
with the small academic magazines and hobbyist publications
that turned to the Net as a cheap way to find readers.
Many if not most still relied on plain text without graphics;
they were little more than archived dispatches to mailing
lists—which was fine because the words mattered above
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>all. One of the best of these was Adam Engst’s <cite>Tidbits</cite>.
Written for Apple owners, it also appeared on the World
Wide Web and bulletin board systems, and Engst claimed
more than 100,000 readers—no small feat for a kitchen-table-style
publisher. Nonconglomerates still provided
most of the magazines on the net, and not all were for
techies or sci-fi buffs. <cite>International Teletimes</cite> was edited by
Ian Wojtowicz, a gifted high school student who lived in
Vancouver, British Columbia. <cite>Teletimes</cite> went out over the
Web with fetching art, not just text, and some of the prose
could have graced <cite>Harper’s</cite> or the <cite>Atlantic</cite>. Recounting a
winter trip by train, a college student named Paul Gribble
wrote: “Every now and then we pass a lake, completely
frozen over, flat and white, smooth as a skating rink. I’d
love to walk to the center of a big frozen lake like that and
just sit there for a while. I’d feel like the first blot of paint
on a fresh silk canvas.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Many steps up from <cite>Teletimes</cite>, in business terms, was
<cite>Global Net Navigator</cite>. Like the <cite>N &amp; O</cite> in North Carolina,
<cite>GNN</cite> was trying to use advertising to support its activities,
and you could see ads from companies as large as Digital
Equipment Corporation. <cite>GNN</cite> was not just technical. It
posted informative, brightly written articles on topics
ranging from money to food and travel. <cite>Wired</cite> magazine
was on the Net, too, with an offshoot called <cite>HotWired</cite>,
which itself wandered far from technical topics and attracted
lucrative ads from the likes of Volvo and AT&amp;T.
None of these publications, of course, happened to be a
Household Name like Time Warner’s <cite>Time</cite> or <cite>People</cite>.
Many experts felt that as a profitable medium for big-time
magazines—and let’s not confuse size with quality or lack
thereof—the Internet had a long way to go.</p>

<p class='c018'>Jeffrey Dearth offered at least an interim answer.
Teaming up with a small corporation with the grand name
of the Internet Company, Dearth offered the Electronic
Newsstand. Like the Pathfinder or <cite>N &amp; O</cite>’s Net edition, the
Newsstand was a godsend to browsers. You could wander
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>through sample articles from <cite>Business Week</cite>; <cite>Field &amp;
Stream</cite>; <cite>The Economist</cite>; <cite>The New Yorker</cite>; <cite>National Review</cite>;
<cite>Maclean’s</cite>, Canada’s largest newsweekly; or The <cite>New
Republic</cite>, of which Dearth himself was publisher. The
Time Warner experiment notwithstanding, most of the
Names were far behind. Dearth offered them the equivalent
of a catch-up course or at least some solid remedial instruction.
They could test the waters of the Net to see how
much interest their articles drew, before deciding whether
to set up their own areas there. Via the Newsstand, magazines
could accept subscription orders.</p>

<p class='c018'>But order taking was a long way from fancier “interactivity”—to
use a pet term of media people—and this
was where Time Warner’s Pathfinder area would shine.
The area didn’t just recycle magazines on the Net, it also
offered powerful tools to find old articles by typing in
search words or the names of topics. From the start, the
searching capability was among the more popular services.
Soon Pathfinder would include hypertext links that
let you go from an article on a certain topic to an ongoing
discussion. Already Time Warner provided special services
such as one for gardeners. They could type in their
general wishes about flowers and supply their location
and other odds and ends, and then Time would offer tips
on what to grow. It also allowed inquirers find out how
their congressman or senator had voted on certain key issues.
And many more applications like this were on the
way. What’s more, people could talk back to Time Warner
writers and others by way of an advanced bulletin board
system designed for the Web. It was <em>much</em> easier to use
than the <cite>N &amp; O</cite>’s.</p>

<p class='c018'>Not everyone liked the Web area. One woman hated
the “overstuffed” artwork—others said it gobbled up too
much downloading time. She also chided <cite>Time</cite> for putting
out the online version of <cite>Sunset</cite> magazine “for Northern
Californians still living in their ’50s ranch houses.” I myself,
however, enjoyed the kitsch and flashy, busy look of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>the Web area as a whole. That was the way the <em>real</em> magazines
came across; this was pop culture, not the <cite>Kenyon
Review</cite>.</p>

<p class='c018'>Almost immediately the <cite>Time</cite> board teemed with
lively talk on issues ranging from Clintonian stupidities
to, yes, the future of the electronic medium. I felt much
more comfortable here than in the message area of the
<cite>N &amp; O</cite>; people on the <cite>Time</cite> board spoke their minds more
freely. Some amusing posts showed up. Amazingly, the
software let people key in their own identities, and the late
Henry Luce, cofounder of <cite>Time</cite>, arose from the grave as
luce@pastmytime.com. One message appeared, truthfully
or not, with the name of a staffer at <cite>U.S. News &amp; World
Report</cite>. He promised that <cite>U.S. News</cite> would set up an outpost
on the Net soon, and someone at <cite>Time</cite> twitted him for
not answering e-mail promptly. Despite my fondness for
the reporting in <cite>U.S. News</cite>, I had to agree. Researching a
Net guide for political activists, I’d written <cite>U.S. News</cite> six
months ago and had yet to receive an answer.</p>

<p class='c018'>Time Warner also showed network savvy by following
the example of <cite>GNN</cite> and similar publications and providing
some hypertext pointers to the rest of the Internet,
rather than expecting readers to stay within its own area.
Time Warner even enlisted some of its household names
in the cause. The electronic version of <cite>Entertainment
Weekly</cite>, for example, did not just review Madonna or
Springsteen or the latest Hollywood films; it also directed
people to popular, entertainment-oriented sites on the Net
itself by way of hypertext links. I still wanted to see many,
many more links—a strength of <cite>GNN</cite>. But I suspected that
would come in time.</p>

<p class='c018'>Planning the Pathfinder service, Time Warner had
even consulted with the publisher of <cite>Wired</cite>. “They’re providing
real news, not just PR blather or sales areas for
their products,” said Chip Bayers, the managing editor of
<cite>HotWired</cite>, the <cite>Wired</cite> offshoot on the Web. And he was
right.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>I myself was no cheerleader for Time Warner in some
ways—I worried about media concentrations.<a id='r4.16' /><a href='#f4.16' class='c022'><sup>[4.16]</sup></a> But here
the Suits deserved their due. <cite>HotWired</cite> offered avant-garde
graphics on the Web along with services such as
bulletin boards and free archives; I was pleased, yet
hardly surprised. <cite>Wired</cite>, after all, was still a bit of an upstart
despite heavy investment from a corporate arm of
the powerful Newhouse family.<a id='r4.17' /><a href='#f4.17' class='c022'><sup>[4.17]</sup></a> But Time Warner was
different—the epitome of the journalistic and Hollywood
establishments, a company with many benefits from the
status quo. I recalled the upbeat stories that <cite>Time</cite> had run
about the world of 500-channel television. Such articles
betrayed far more tolerance of the “one to many” broadcast
model, as opposed to the newer, more anarchistic
model of the Net. Many in the Time Life tower, especially
on the entertainment side, might still harbor these less
adventurous visions. And yet the company was now
spreading its bets around. That seemed sensible enough,
given the chilliness that some test markets had shown interactive
TV.</p>

<p class='c018'>A <cite>Time</cite> writer named Philip Elmer-DeWitt had grown
more and more attuned to the potential of the Net. He was
a regular on The WELL, the bulletin board system frequented
by many of the elite journalists on the Internet.
Again and again Elmer-DeWitt showed up on newsgroups
and mailing lists with spunky, opinionated posts on such
topics as the media and telecommunications. He lent his
name to a successful legal campaign to aid Brock Meeks,
a small publisher on the Net who faced a libel suit from a
mail-order tycoon in Ohio. What’s more, Elmer-DeWitt
was sensitive to the threats from the Clipper chip, which
Washington might use someday to invade the privacy of
millions of Americans. He clearly represented the interests
of his employer, but he did so with a good mix of wit
and smarts that endeared him to many on the Internet.
His electronic signature said, “Read Time on America
Online where we are paid to take abuse.”</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>Enlivened by posts from Netfolks and WELLfolks
whom Elmer-DeWitt had befriended, <cite>Time</cite>’s message
board thrived on America Online. But now, quite correctly,
<cite>Time</cite> had run an article pointing out the advantages
of the Internet from the perspective of publishers.
<cite>Time</cite> raised a big question, the same one Frank Daniels
had asked. Did publications really have to fork over such a
hefty percentage of their online revenue to commercial
services, such as America Online, when the Internet existed?
Time Warner’s well-stocked area on the Net was itself
an answer of sorts. Granted, the company’s outpost on
America Online wasn’t about to vanish. Time Warner was
testing both interactive TV and computers as transmission
vehicles; similarly the company was not committing itself
to any single network in cyberspace. I took it for granted
that sooner or later Time Warner might end up on the network
that Bill Gates was starting. Just as <cite>Time</cite> reached
newsstands everywhere, the electronic equivalent could
seek out eyes wherever the phone lines led. <cite>Sports
Illustrated</cite>, <cite>Fortune</cite>, and <cite>People</cite> would soon be on
CompuServe. And yet Time Warner’s priority in the computer
world was clear: the Internet above all else, at least
for the moment.</p>

<p class='c018'>“When we put <cite>Time</cite> on America Online,” said Walter
Isaacson, editor of new media at Time, “it is done on their
server, using their software, and only someone subscribing
to America Online and using America Online software
can access it. On the Web, anyone using public domain
software can get to it.” I could just have substituted “<cite>News
&amp; Observer</cite>” for “<cite>Time</cite>,” an impression only strengthened
by the next sentence: “We have a direct relationship to our
readers.” Isaacson went on: “There will be massive
amounts more content from Time Inc. on the Web than on
America Online or CompuServe, which will just feature
individual magazines.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Some twenty-two magazines were to go on the Web.
Isaacson said around ten editors would participate full or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>part time. Total investment in the Web site was to reach
the “mid six figures,” and “with advertising it should be in
the black within a <a id='corr149.3'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='year.'>year.”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_149.3'><ins class='correction' title='year.'>year.”</ins></a></span> “There may be a mix of ads and
subscription fees,” Isaacson said. Mercifully, the advertising
would not be the intrusive Prodigy kind that popped
up on the bottom of my screen in a garish, Vegas style.</p>

<p class='c018'>Jim Kinsella, the ex-newspaper editor who presided
over the Web area, said he was pushing for a subscription
fee of around $8 a month. I would have wanted the price
to be a few dollars lower, but it was fine if I got enough
for my money. If nothing else, Kinsella wanted readers to
be able to stay online without the time charges that made
thousands unplug their hookups with America Online
and similar services. A product manager with Microsoft
would later say as much to the <cite>New York Times</cite> in discussing
Bill Gates’ new service: “We’re trying to reduce
the threshold of pain. We think users hate connect
fees.”<a id='r4.18' /><a href='#f4.18' class='c022'><sup>[4.18]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c018'>Kinsella’s $8 monthly fee—his proposed figure, not
Time Warner’s—would be for Pathfinder itself, not for the
Internet connection. I did some quick math. Pathfinder
could indeed be a competitive possibility if Time Warner
were able to lower the cost of using the Internet by way of
cable television from the $75-$100 a month that people
typically paid for such arrangements.</p>

<p class='c018'>Mass use might enable Time Warner to undercut the
$20 that the <cite>N &amp; O</cite> presently charged. Typical readers
might want to keep reading a <em>local</em> newspaper, and the
<cite>N &amp; O</cite> could drop its own prices, but this was still a good
example of how national media just might drain at least
some readers away from the local media. Understandably,
Kinsella was thinking in mass, national terms, as I would
have done. He predicted that within five or ten years half
the country might be able to reach the Net in one way or
another. Others at Time were similarly optimistic.</p>

<p class='c018'>Not everyone in late 1994 was so sanguine. Mark
Stahlman, for example, a media expert in New York,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>shrugged off Net publications as “just the latest in a series
of fads.” Richard M. Smith, <cite>Newsweek</cite>’s editor in chief who
was running the new-media committee of the Magazine
Publishers of America, was skeptical about online services
in general: “The people who are making money are
the people who are running conferences about it.”<a id='r4.19' /><a href='#f4.19' class='c022'><sup>[4.19]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c018'>Smith was oversimplifying somewhat, but formidable
barriers did exist, of which one of the biggest happened to
be the limits of the technology. Reading electronic text for
hours on end could be murder on both the back and the
eyes. All day long I sat in front of a computer screen; the
last thing I wanted was to have to do it while I wandered
through magazines or books. Television wouldn’t do: I
hated the idea of reading a magazine or novel from ten
feet away. Besides, didn’t magazines and books exist to be
enjoyed in bed, on the hammock, or at the beach?</p>

<p class='c018'>Mightn’t Silicon Valley, however, come out with small,
tablet-style computers designed for reading? “TeleReaders”
could feature optional keyboards for people who wanted to
use them as general purpose computers. Screens, needless
to say, must be much sharper than today, and without so
much flicker. Batteries should last longer. And, ideally, you
should be able to dart from place to place in a newspaper
or magazine by merely touching a “pen” to the appropriate
part of your screen. <em>That</em> was what the magazine, newspaper,
and book industries needed, rather than just more
conferences. Washington could even encourage this by
way of a focused procurement program for schools and libraries;
the same machines could even be used for electronic
forms for government and commerce.</p>

<p class='c018'>Roger Fidler of Knight-Ridder had already been experimenting
with mockups of tablet-style machines. He
was more interested in a newspaper-oriented approach
and less in a general one than I was. But the basic idea
was the same—words needn’t be captives of the printed
page. The real question was this: How soon until the right
technology appeared? Electronic magazines such as Time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>Warner’s would still make money without a TeleRead-style
approach, but the full potential would not be
reached, especially if more children abandoned words for
TV and computer images. That was even truer for the
world of books. Even more than magazines and newspapers,
e-books suffered from the limits of technology. It
wasn’t just a question of the right machine for viewing; at
issue were other matters such as copy protection and
billing. But at least some partial solutions were on the
way, and even with the present difficulties of the medium,
online bookstores were sprouting up on the Internet. One
of the best was run by Laura Fillmore, an editor in
Massachusetts who had once worked for Little, Brown.</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>An elderly man owned a charming old store in a
southern town with the standard magnolias, wrought iron
staircases, and hot, moist summers, and he loved to brag
about his shiny new safe. Most customers did not know
about it or care. Rather than worrying so much about the
protection of his wealth, he might have been better off to
imitate his rivals and invest his money in air-conditioning
instead of the safe.</p>

<p class='c018'>The man reminded me of myopic publishers and authors.
Not quite grasping the full potential of the Internet,
they fretted too much about copyright protection, and not
enough about making their wares friendly to shoppers. A
pay-per-read company in Virginia was typical here. You
could download its books off the Internet, but you did not
enjoy such niceties as links to other titles online. Nor
could you print more than a page or so at once. Beyond
that, you had to clutter up your computer system with a
$25 gadget hooked up to the printer port. If you were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>working on tight deadlines and were rich and desperate
enough, you might stomach this copy protection system.
But I dreaded the possibility of its adoption by the book industry
as a whole; established publishers and writers just
might see the world pass them by if they cared too much
about cybersafes and not enough about customer amenities.
Many megabytes of good, free reading awaited the
public on the Web, and not everyone understood the value
that professional editors and writers could add.</p>

<p class='c018'>Nowadays, however, more publishers and hangers-on
were catching on to the nuances of the Net. Among them
was Laura Fillmore, a publishing consultant who owned
the Online BookStore in Rockport, Massachusetts. She
must have driven some traditionalists crazy. Fillmore actually
had the notion that ASCII—text in a popular format,
without italics and the other trimmings—should be free to
everyone. She loved Project Gutenberg, which an Illinois
academic had started to put classics and other works on
the Net at no charge. Fillmore was the antithesis of a
techno-geek, the kind of woman who just might read
Dickens to her two children on snowy days, and who was
a regular on the speaker circuit within her industry. She
had majored in English at Barnard College and worked
for a publishing company that dated back to the nineteenth
century. Fillmore helped bridge the past and the
electronic era. Her vision wasn’t quite the same as mine,
but it was worlds apart from that of piracy-fixated publishers
who saw electronic readers as a criminal class.</p>

<p class='c018'>The move to the Net was, in her opinion, part of a long
evolution toward a new form of decentralized publishing.
She recalled when the great houses didn’t farm out editing
and other tasks as often as they do today, and when almost
every book took nine months to reach the stores. “Back in
the late ’70s when I was at Little, Brown,” she said, “we
needed to get special permission to use <a id='corr152.35'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Fed'>Ex</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_152.35'><ins class='correction' title='Fed'>Ex</ins></a></span>. When an
author wanted his sales figures, I’d walk up the street to
the top floor of a separate building where Rose, the lady
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>with the P &amp; L cards, had been keeping tabs for twenty
years, and I’d sign out the neatly penciled card and carefully
carry it to my boss, wrapping it in plastic against the
weather if necessary. I passed the copyediting department
with their well-stocked reference library, a bastion against
inaccuracies, and the design department, smelling of wax,
hung with rulers, sizing wheels, and X-acto knives.”<a id='r4.20' /><a href='#f4.20' class='c022'><sup>[4.20]</sup></a>
The industry, though, had changed; now freelancers
throughout the country, not just in New York or Boston,
were often editing and even publishing books. Fillmore
herself had gone into freelance editorial work years before,
and she still remembered “the shrinking feeling in
my stomach the first time I bought a computer setup back
in 1984: $10,000 of the bank’s money for an XT and an HP
LaserJet. The salesman left, I was back at the C prompt,
and the room grew dark. No matter which buttons I
pushed, ‘Abort, Retry, Ignore’ glared back persistently.
Finally, I chose none of the above and unplugged the
whole thing.”<a id='r4.21' /><a href='#f4.21' class='c022'><sup>[4.21]</sup></a> Fillmore overcame her technophobia, but
the chaos of change still made her uncomfortable.
“Increasing speed and volume have led to high job
turnover, a blurring of disciplines. Our computerized tools
allow the editor to become a typist, a designer, and a type-setter,
the designer becomes a software junkie, a graphic
artist, a prepress house. No time for galleys! Straight to
pages! No time for pages; straight to film. The drop dead
date is bottom line. Sales are needed this quarter.”<a id='r4.22' /><a href='#f4.22' class='c022'><sup>[4.22]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c018'>Years ago, competition had reached the point where
many typesetting jobs left the United States. “We even
hired freelancers thirdhand in Singapore and Haiti,”
Fillmore recalled in a speech. “The publisher hired me; I
hired someone stateside to hire someone in-country to
hire the keyboarder and, still, the publisher ended paying
maybe half what the job would have cost him at $15 per
hour. Our topic today is slavery.”<a id='r4.23' /><a href='#f4.23' class='c022'><sup>[4.23]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c018'>But in Fillmore’s opinion, this distributed form of publishing,
where tasks went every which way, would take a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>newer and more humane form. In the 1980s books had
appeared on computer networking, a kinder technology
than the brutal, production-oriented variety of the past.
And now Fillmore saw in networks a chance to “elicit life
from people” who used computers to communicate. Her
own “epiphany” came when a Net-oriented writer, John
Quarterman, author of <cite>The Matrix</cite>, introduced her to “the
then alien concept of electronic mail. My assistant would
pick up mail from my lone correspondent, the author,
print it out, put it in my in box, and I would handwrite responses
which she would input and send back in due
time. It sounds quaint, but it seemed to make sense to me
at the time—in the same way computerized typesetting
distributed though unconnected PCs made sense.” On the
Net, everyone could publish, not just giant publishing
houses. And so Quarterman could forward to her some
public messages from students who were defying the
Chinese Army in Tiananmen Square. They could speak
for themselves; no one edited them. They weren’t like the
freelance typists in Haiti: They were not “hidden and
voiceless behind four middlemen” and “with no hope of a
phone, much less an Internet connection.”<a id='r4.24' /><a href='#f4.24' class='c022'><sup>[4.24]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c018'>The overlap in Fillmore’s mind, between publishing
and communicating via the Net, was entirely natural.
When the Haitians typed, they created a digitized version
of the book they were working on. They were not just
transferring words to paper. Bits and bytes, once created,
could go anywhere.</p>

<p class='c018'>Fillmore, of course, was hardly the first to think of consolidating
knowledge. As early as 1945 a scientist had published
a preternaturally farsighted <cite>Atlantic Monthly</cite> article
that was to electronic publishing what Leonardo da Vinci’s
notebooks were to inventions in general. Vannevar Bush
had proposed a memex, a microfilm-based device that
could bring together knowledge from many disciplines—along
with the thoughts of the user. It would be, in other
words, a cross between a personal file cabinet and a giant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>library. In a speech, Fillmore quoted a key passage: “The
human mind ... operates by association. With one item in
its grasp, it snaps instantly to the next that is suggested by
the association of thoughts, in accordance with some intricate
web of trails covered by the brain.”<a id='r4.25' /><a href='#f4.25' class='c022'><sup>[4.25]</sup></a> Bush might as
well have been describing the World Wide Web and its links
that allow you to click on “Boeing” and see “Airplanes” or
click on “Clinton” and see “Presidents.” Ted Nelson, a
dreamer-writer-programmer, was thinking of the memex
when he invented hypertext links. That concept, in turn, excited
Tim Berners-Lee, a staffer at a physics institute in
Berne, Switzerland, who was the father of the Web—the vast
network of computers through which I could retrieve the
Raleigh <cite>News and Observer</cite>, <cite>Time</cite>, and Fillmore’s offerings.</p>

<p class='c018'>Back in 1992, however, the World Wide Web was a
fraction of its present size, and programmers had yet to
release easy, graphically oriented browsers such as
Mosaic that would help tame the Web. Even more than
today, people needed books to fathom the Net. And yet no
popular-level guide was in print. So it was entirely fitting
that when Fillmore decided to create a book from
scratch—rather than just produce it for a publisher—the
Internet was the subject. This how-to guide was <cite>The
Internet Companion</cite>, the author was Tracy LaQuey, and
the paper publisher was Addison-Wesley. Fillmore kept
the network rights and looked forward to distributing the
book through her new Online BookStore. Barry Shein of
Software Tool &amp; Die, the first commercial service to hook
ordinary mortals into the Internet, had offered her space
on his bank of hard disks. “He described his operation,”
she said, “as basically an electronic store with empty
shelves and a cash register at the door. I decided that I’d
find electronic properties to fill these shelves.”<a id='r4.26' /><a href='#f4.26' class='c022'><sup>[4.26]</sup></a> But the
Internet at the time had Acceptable Use Policies that prevented
her from making a profit. What to do?</p>

<p class='c018'>Fillmore hit on a solution that actually rewarded her
for an idealistic approach to publishing. She gave away—with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>great luck in the end—ASCII files from the book in
hopes of drumming up interest in the paper version.
“Who wants to read hundreds of pages in ASCII anyway?”
Fillmore would later ask. Unadorned ASCII by itself
wasn’t always that pleasant to read, and many people
liked the Net version well enough to shell out money for a
paper book. “Even our publisher was supportive of our effort,”
Fillmore said, “and happy with the resulting sales
figures.”<a id='r4.27' /><a href='#f4.27' class='c022'><sup>[4.27]</sup></a> Orders poured in from as far off as Finland and
Korea. Netfolks all over the world could learn of Fillmore’s
offering immediately rather than waiting for reviews to
show up in local magazines and newspapers.</p>

<p class='c018'>Within two years, <cite>Companion</cite> had sold hundreds of
thousands of copies. Al Gore had written the foreword just
before his election as vice president, but the freebies on
the Net certainly hadn’t hurt. Other publishers also found
that free copies could be a boon, not a bane. <cite>Zen and the
Art of the Internet</cite> (Prentice Hall) and <cite>The Hacker’s
Dictionary</cite> (MIT Press) similarly flew off the racks.
“Giving something valuable away for free,” Fillmore said,
“can make money.”<a id='r4.28' /><a href='#f4.28' class='c022'><sup>[4.28]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c018'>Of course some would say she hadn’t actually published
online. Rather she had used the medium to promote
a paper book. Still, the prospect of purely electronic publishing
beckoned. “I was seduced by the prospect of the
then 10 million people on the Internet—10 million literate
people with disposable incomes—attached to the Net. Why
not acquire lots of Internet rights to lots of books and put
them online at the Online BookStore. Surely some percentage
of those people would buy files of a popular author’s
books for a reasonable price.”<a id='r4.29' /><a href='#f4.29' class='c022'><sup>[4.29]</sup></a> Fillmore was sensible
enough to price her offerings for consumers who were
spending their own money, not their bosses’. Some commercial
databases were charging as much as $200 per
hour or more, while Fillmore was thinking more in terms
of $5, say, for a short story downloaded from the Net.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>The test story was “Umney’s Last Case,” a fifty-page
Stephen King story from a collection called <cite>Nightmares
and Dreamscapes</cite>. King was among the best-selling writers
on the planet. Fillmore dreamed of tens of thousands
of dialups even if “Umney” intrigued only 1 percent of the
10 million people on the Net at the time. Fillmore had
picked out just the right King story, one where a time traveler
gave a Toshiba T-1000 laptop computer to a tough detective
around 1939—someone who in turn used his
“plastic Buck Rogers steno machine” to write a story
within King’s own tale.</p>

<p class='c018'>Fillmore’s “Umney” project was a sensation at the
biggest book fair in the world, the one at Frankfurt; upbeat
stories appeared in places ranging from European
news programs to the <cite>Wall Street Journal</cite>. She witnessed
“a vast amount of smoke, a tremendous marketing boost
for the printed book again, lots of noise—and by extension,
lots of profit for the publisher and for the author—but
handfuls of per-copy sales.”<a id='r4.30' /><a href='#f4.30' class='c022'><sup>[4.30]</sup></a> They didn’t even pay for
all the phone calls used to set up the deal.</p>

<p class='c018'>I was hardly surprised. Enjoying access to many megs
of free material on the Net, the typical denizen didn’t want
to shell out even $5 for the story even if she or he could
simply fax in a credit card number. It wasn’t that King’s
work was worthless—quite the opposite. Rather, on the
Internet and with this business model, “Umney” at most
any realistic price could not compete with free material
such as Usenet postings.</p>

<p class='c018'>Yes, the Net teemed with sci-fi and fantasy fans. But as I
saw it, they were too busy talking to each other, and, while
they would have been delighted to download “Umney” for
free, they balked at spending the $5. You might say that
“Umney” was like a typical TV program. The appeal was
potentially broad but not deep. Pay-per-view wasn’t that
much of a hit on cable TV, and the same principle applied
here. “Umney” could enhance a collection of material for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>subscribers—we go back to the flat-fee example of the
<cite>News &amp; Observer</cite> and Jim Kinsella’s vision for Time
Warner—but even a Stephen King story wasn’t strong
enough on its own for online use. Part of the problem, I believed,
was the medium. The right technology for reading
fifty-page short stories just wasn’t out there yet. With the
proper equipment, the value would increase.</p>

<p class='c018'>Besides, even now, Fillmore could use a license or
sponsorship model. She sold “Umney” to two computer
networks, one of them CompuServe, which gained the
right to post the story for a week during a conference on
paperless publishing. “Hundreds of people have accessed
it,” Fillmore said. The future possibilities were evident
now. Corporations someday might sponsor books on computer
networks the way they sponsored programs on CBS
or NBC. In fact, whole sites on the Net—with the names of
companies—could serve as homes for innovative projects.
Sun Microsystems was oriented toward UNIX, relied
heavily on sales to Net users, and benefited from the goodwill
and publicity that its SunSite libraries enjoyed. Fare
ranged from presidential speeches to the Internet
Underground Music Archive; there could be a place for
commercial e-books as well in these high-tech sandboxes,
as Fillmore jokingly called such areas.</p>

<p class='c018'>The sponsorship model wasn’t perfect, of course.
Fillmore herself was the first to wonder which corporations
would have sponsored writings about the uprising in
Tiananmen Square. Big companies often favored upbeat
material. As I saw it, fiction and nonfiction books alike
might suffer if this model alone prevailed. They differed
from newspapers and magazines; book publishers thought
more in terms of individual properties, and beyond that,
publications such as the <cite>N &amp; O</cite> and <cite>Time</cite> already enjoyed
strong identities from their paper incarnations. The new
media were less a challenge to their editorial integrity. But
many sponsored books might degenerate into the Net
equivalent of the wretched infomercials on TV, the ones
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>where over-the-hill actors “interviewed” astrologers or
memory experts, and where the audiences clapped thunderously
on cue.</p>

<p class='c018'>Wisely, Fillmore did not give up on “Umney” entirely—it
was still online when I was writing this chapter—nor
did she quit using the Net to promote writings on paper.
Even more important, she tried out writings that took advantage
of links to other material on the Web.</p>

<p class='c018'><cite>Bless This Food: Amazing Grace in Praise of Food</cite> was
an example of prime material for hypertext. The paper
book bought together food-related prayers from many
times and places. But everything was contained. You couldn’t
wander outside the printed pages. Thanks to Fillmore,
however, you could click on Buddhist-related material and
see a Buddha’s image piped in from the Smithsonian. You
could even e-mail the author of <cite>Bless</cite>, Adrian Butash.
Fillmore wasn’t just selling the book itself—she was offering
it as a “dashboard” that could take you to related material
on the Net. Certainly the Smithsonian hadn’t had <cite>Bless</cite> in
mind when it posted the picture of Buddha. However,
through the pointers in the electronic edition, you could
learn of this image and view it in just the right context; that,
after all, was the splendor of the Web. Quite honestly, then,
Fillmore could charge $25 for a book that sold in hardback
from Delacorte for $18.95. She was giving you <em>more</em> for
your money. Besides, if you proposed new links and she
liked them, you would receive some royalties. You, the
reader, could be part of the book and the author’s life. We
could all be editors.</p>

<p class='c018'>As a writer, I had somewhat mixed feelings about this.
I loved e-mail from readers. But I was already spending too
many hours a day on electronic correspondence of one
kind or another. I hated the idea of suffering a constant
stream of e-mail from Project X when I wanted to move on
to Project Y. If this model won out, writers would have to be
much choosier about the projects they took on—knowing
that publishers expected more commitment.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>Given the deluge of 50,000 titles a year that readers
face just from U.S. publishers, more than a few people
would enjoy such a prospect. But they shouldn’t grow too
complacent. With electronic publishing much cheaper
than the paper variety, we might eventually see 100,000
commercially published titles a year. I, for one, wouldn’t
mind as long as quality and royalties don’t suffer. The
problem is not too many books, but rather the need for
better software to sort through them—or for more hypertext
editors to issue good pointers. That is one reason why
I loved the idea of publishers selling pointers as well as
actual material.</p>

<p class='c018'>Not every writer would be open-minded, of course;
even Fillmore at first had feared hypertext. When O’Reilly
and Associates put one of her papers on the Web through
<cite>GNN</cite>—spreading around her observations on electronic
publishing—she saw all kinds of links. By clicking on blue
letters, for example, readers would call up material about
a founder of Internet. Fillmore felt as if a Philistine had
taken her beautiful bowl, her self-contained piece of writing,
and turned it into a colander. Some writers might see
a parallel in another way: Suppose the colander leaked
readers, who, seeing the links, dove off into another area
of the Net, and <em>never</em> returned. Fillmore had adjusted to
this possibility, and I could, too. Just like Zonker Harris I
was of the “May the best server win!” mentality, except
that I refused to confuse popularity with merit. Books
weren’t like sports servers.</p>

<p class='c018'>From society’s viewpoint, another issue presented itself
here. Both Fillmore and I wondered about the damage
that television and computers might be doing to
people’s attention spans. “Attention deficit disorder seems
to have arisen at the same time that computers have
spread to the home and office,” she said, “and I don’t
think that’s an accident. How many people age twelve
and younger are capable of reading 300 pages of sustained
argument about anything?” Another worry arose,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>too, in my mind. Like Frank Daniels, I realized that an
entire generation of children was spending more time
gazing at computer and TV screens than they devoted to
books and traditional newspapers.</p>

<p class='c018'>I felt that technology was destiny, that Washington
and other governments should promote computers that
encouraged the receptive to read e-books hour after hour.
Too much of the new-style education, as envisioned by
many, would be task oriented—would be <em>training</em> as
much as <em>education</em> per se. That was fine for technical
matters where, for example, a future factory worker
might want to learn the basics of engine design. Hypertext
was superb. The student could study a diagram of a
diesel engine, click on an individual part, and read and
hear a detailed explanation of its function. But I wanted
technology that also encouraged people to read and absorb
whole books.</p>

<p class='c018'>If book readers were too small a minority, then countries
such as the United States would be less democratic
and more oligarchic, with the elite all too able to manipulate
the other citizens. Some social critics such as Neil
Postman demonized technology as a source of mindless
distractions for the masses. I, however, saw opportunity if
we acted soon enough before we lost more children to TV.
That meant sharp screens, smaller, lighter machines, and
other advances—which would come sooner or later, but
which could be hastened by the coming of a focused procurement
program. Washington should assure the Valley
a market for the right hardware. It should also try harder
to help schools absorb it, so the machines wouldn’t just sit
idle in closets.</p>

<p class='c018'>A national digital library, not just a digital store leading
to commercial collections, was just as essential as better
hardware. Today a college student researching the
effect of Shakespeare on popular culture is able to find the
Bard’s work at the school library. But what about tracking
down newer books that the library couldn’t afford to buy?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>Also, only one student could read a paper copy at a time;
suppose a professor wanted many students to compare
impressions of a novel, especially one that was out of print
and long gone from the bookstores? People on the technical
side could benefit even more than those in the humanities.
The best and most recent guides to Microsoft Word
or Windows, for example, didn’t come from educators;
rather they came from the private sector. The faster this
knowledge could reach average citizens, the easier it
would be to upgrade the labor force.</p>

<p class='c018'>A national digital library, moreover, would help many
businesses market their goods. A food company trying to
sell a new line of rice, for example, could instantly call up
cookbooks of many ethnic groups and find out the relationship
between food and the cultures. In an era of customized
products, companies needed to learn quickly
about niche markets. That would be especially true as
business globalized; corporate planners had to keep on
top of conditions in many countries.</p>

<p class='c018'>So TeleRead-style libraries—which let people look
through many kinds of information, everything from
books to UN reports—could make real contributions in
the United States and elsewhere. If nothing else, governments
needed to understand the possible efficiencies.
Yes, public and academic librarians would choose books.
But innovative, private firms would own the computer
banks (well backed up) storing the books and other material;
many different contractors, always trying to outdo
each other’s technologies, could compete. Other efficiencies
would accrue. Pooling the public libraries of
rich and poor citizens would help everyone by increasing
the variety of books available to all.</p>

<p class='c018'>Big Brother needn’t run a national digital library.
Subject-oriented librarians in many cities might acquire
material; in effect they would be putting a public library
system online, one that reflected the tastes of, say, Lyons as
well as Paris. How much more supple than the overcentralized
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>approach that the French now favored for their national
library! The elite librarians could still identify the
books <em>they</em> had blessed, but the provincials could have their
say as well; and, given the variability of literary tastes over
the ages, the latter in some cases might prevail anyway.</p>

<p class='c018'>What’s more, by gambling money up front to qualify for
royalties from TeleRead, writers and commercial publishers
could bypass the librarians. Book people such as Laura
Fillmore could thrive under this approach. A national library
could offer e-books not only to citizens directly but
also to independent-minded entrepreneurs such as
Fillmore, who could charge for their custom links. I loved
the idealism she showed in suggesting that ASCII be free. It
was a good model in many cases for today. But I feared that
as computers grew better for book reading—and it would
happen eventually, with or without a TeleRead program—free
ASCII would take away too many paying customers.
And if ASCII books weren’t free? Then, more than ever,
piracy would occur regardless of various legal and technological
precautions. So the answer should be free national
digital libraries—well stocked and with fair pay for writers
and publishers—to reduce the temptation to bypass copy
protection. Use tracking to report dialup counts and pay
originators of material, but not for billing. <em>That</em> was the way
to take full advantage of the technology and keep market
incentives while promoting literacy.</p>

<p class='c018'>Rich countries would be the first to start libraries of
this kind. They could safeguard their intellectual property
by helping poorer countries get books online if the latter
agreed to honor copyright laws. The time would come for
national and international Electronic Peace Corps to
make this possible. EPCs could help upgrade Third World
phone systems on site and share knowledge via e-books,
e-mail, two-way video, and otherwise. To enforce global
copyright law, we needed carrots as well as sticks.</p>

<p class='c018'>What’s more, governments could protect books with
technology far less cumbersome than the $25 gadgets that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>the pay-per-read bookstore in Virginia used. <em>Then</em> e-text
stood a chance. I thought of the old merchant down South:
Safes were useful, but only if the customers could enjoy
an air-conditioner—an easy-to-use digital library for all of
a country’s citizens.</p>

<p class='c018'>National digital libraries, of course, could link up with
each other and form an official world library someday. But,
given the many cultural differences, that was impossible
now. National libraries, then, were the way to go—with opportunities
for citizens in different countries to read each
other’s books when governments allowed this. I pitied the
censors. In an era of international computer networks, national
libraries would end up anyway as one big global library
for citizens of open societies and for the more
resourceful people of countries such as Iran. Simply put,
national digital libraries would make it so much easier to
market or shop for books internationally. When a Swedish
anarchist heard about TeleRead, his big question wasn’t,
“Isn’t this an opportunity for cultural imperialism?” Instead
it was, “Will I be able to read American best-sellers as
quickly as people there can?” Whatever the kind of book—a
Tom Clancy thriller or an anarchistic tract—TeleRead libraries
would allow easy global distribution.</p>

<p class='c018'>In rich countries such as the United States and Sweden,
the need for national digital libraries would only grow
with the introduction of better televisions and video
games, not to mention the distractions of the Net itself—including
virtual reality, at some point. Even in wealthy
nations, people had only so much disposable income.
How much of it would be left for online books? Mightn’t
we use e-forms and digital libraries to transfer resources
from paperwork to knowledge? As much as I applauded
the good work that Frank Daniels was doing with the
third graders in Raleigh, I was a little put off by the online
questionnaire for adults and children using his BBS.
It asked about favorite TV programs, physical appearance,
sports, and other activities, but a simple question
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>was missing—one that I felt certain would have been on
the list twenty years ago: “What are your favorite books?”</p>

<div class='textbox1 width45'>

<p class='c018'>Spring 1995: An (Interim) Afterword</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>Whatever the medium—newspapers, books, or magazines—many
Netfolks saw the Internet as a path to diversity.
That was partly why I liked seeing <cite>The News &amp;
Observer</cite> online with A. C. Snow et al. Maybe the Internet
could rescue locally owned newspapers before they all
tumbled down the maws of conglomerates. On May 17,
1995, however, <cite>The NandO Times</cite>, the Webbed newspaper
of the <cite>N &amp; O</cite>, ran a story that I’d never wanted to read. A
chain was buying up the company. For perhaps the first
time, a Net daily reported on the sale of it and its pulped-wood
siblings.</p>

<p class='c018'>A color photo showed Frank Daniels III briefing his
staff. What really caught my eye, however, was a revelation
that I saw later in the <cite>New York Times</cite>: “Frank Daniels
III said he was convinced that the paper needed to find a
larger parent in part to give the paper the resources necessary
to nurture those new electronic efforts.” More than
a few of us newspaper junkies had hoped that the new
technology would help keep the <cite>N &amp; O</cite> local. I recalled one
reason why Daniels had not dumped his <cite>N &amp; O</cite> stock in
the 1980s in favor of an investment in an online service.
“The relationship between a newspaper and a community,”
he had said, “has such a richness and history that
communities shouldn’t lose that.” Now, however, after 101
years in the Daniels family, the <cite>N &amp; O</cite> and trimmings were
going to a California chain for $373 million. The buyer
was McClatchy Newspapers Inc., the former employer of
George Schlukbier, the Daniels’s new-media guru.</p>

<p class='c018'>No wicked corporate conspiracies existed here. The
Danielses simply felt comfortable with McClatchy, which
not only shared the <cite>N &amp; O</cite>’s still basically liberal politics
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>but also enjoyed a good reputation in the newspaper
business.</p>

<p class='c018'>Run out of Sacramento, McClatchy Newspapers was a
family-owned chain with just twelve dailies. It allowed
much more leeway to local editors than many others did,
and I might well have reacted just as the Daniels family
did when the McClatchy people came calling. The <cite>N &amp; O</cite>
mustn’t end up in the hands of some skinflint chain;
McClatchy Newspapers could be an excellent alternative.</p>

<p class='c018'>Still, the sale did not delight me. The Net, after all, was
supposed to be good for small guys, including, presumably,
family-owned enterprises. Josephus Daniels had
bought the <cite>N &amp; O</cite> at that bankruptcy auction in 1894, seen
it through the Roaring Twenties, the stockmarket crash,
and the heyday of his friend FDR. He must have died
thinking that the Daniels name would forever grace the
masthead. From a portrait in the boardroom, he looked
out at his progeny announcing the transaction. Just why
couldn’t all the computers and cables and videocams have
helped strengthen the family business, not force its sale?</p>

<p class='c018'>I could see how the latter may have happened. The
Daniels had had to invest in both the printing press and
the new med<em>ia</em>, with an emphasis on the plural. A story
on newsprint, an Internet audio, and a video would cost
more than just an old-fashioned version. Network-related
expenses of the <cite>N &amp; O</cite> may have been smaller
than the investment in new press, but they would only
grow in the future. No-frills Web areas cost next to nothing
to set up. But net.papers with the very flashiest
graphics and full-motion video would need programmers
and designers and other specialists, not all of them
cheap. At the same time the Daniels wanted to cover
their circulation area well, and that meant a big, expensive
staff of reporters, too.</p>

<p class='c018'>Just as important, however, the <cite>N &amp; O</cite> faced strong
competition for advertisers and readers. Yes, the Net
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>shrank distances and gave smaller companies some new
marketing opportunities. But as shown by Time Warner’s
giant electronic newsstand, it could also create some good
synergies for media conglomerates offering package deals
to national advertisers. In certain respects—hardly all—readers
also benefited. I could key in “Carly Simon,” for
example, and see any stories that might have appeared
about her, not only in <cite>Time</cite> but also in <cite>Entertainment
Weekly</cite> or <cite>People</cite>. Frank Daniels could bring together wire
service news and offbeat items from technical publications
and others. But in the future he couldn’t match the
brand appeal of corporations such as Time Warner.</p>

<p class='c018'>Daniels had a right to be proud of his technological
accomplishments, of course. But from now on, assuming
that he stayed, as he apparently would for the moment, he
would be an employee rather than a member of the owning
family. Forget the Third Wave talk of Net saving us all
from conglomerates. We could all have our own home
pages on the World Wide Web, of course, and maybe put
out little magazines; and IUMA-style startups could always
use the new technology to startle the Goliaths—and
in the end, exceptions notwithstanding, the Internet did
foster diversity. Clearly, though, it was far from an all-purpose
savior for the <cite>N &amp; O</cite>s of the world. However powerful
in North Carolina, the Raleigh newspaper was
hardly on an equal footing when it competed against the
very largest media organizations.</p>

<p class='c018'>As if to underscore that point, eight huge newspaper
publishers had banded together earlier that spring to form
New Century Network, a club for the big boys on the Net.
Some people wondered if the giants might lose out in the
end—readers wanted to tour the Web themselves, not just
confine themselves to material favored by newspaper
coalitions. And maybe New Century wouldn’t end up so
exclusive after all. Also, advertisers might prefer to sprinkle
their cash around the Web rather than focus it on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>newspaper chains—they could pay for links to their pages
from many sites without much ado. The natural economies
of the Net might yet win out over the business plans of the
giants. Still, for the moment, publishers such as Gannett
and the Washington Post Company were apparently setting
the tone of New Century itself. The 185 New Century papers
claimed more than 23 million paying readers.</p>

<p class='c018'>“New Century might raise antitrust questions,” wrote
Rory O’Connor, a reporter for the <cite>San Jose Mercury News</cite>,
part of Knight-Ridder, a chain in New Century. Peter
Winter, interim chief executive of New Century, said the
publishers were “comfortable with our conformance to
antitrust statutes.”<a id='r4.31' /><a href='#f4.31' class='c022'><sup>[4.31]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c018'>Antitrust was the talk of the newspaper and online industries.
In early June the U.S. Justice Department said it
was studying the network that Microsoft aimed to launch
in August. Just by clicking on the proper icon available
through the Windows 95 operating system, people could
join the Microsoft Network. And some newspapers and
other online services feared that Microsoft could stifle the
competition. In a year Windows might sell 20-40 million
copies; what if several million users clicked?</p>

<p class='c018'>Newspapers worried increasingly about the Microsoft
Network and other online services. American Opinion
Research of Princeton, N.J., found that almost a fifth of the
surveyed editors and publishers thought they might lose
more advertising to online services than to television.
Nearly three-quarters said the business was in good shape
now. Just a half felt the same would be true by the year
2005.<a id='r4.32' /><a href='#f4.32' class='c022'><sup>[4.32]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c018'>The newspaper chains tried to fight back. Large papers
now owned 11 percent of the shares in Netscape
Communications, the wizards behind the fastest and best
browser on the Web. For the moment things seemed fine
for the public. Netscape came up with new wrinkles that
other companies didn’t offer, such as the ability for Web
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>pages to sprout color backgrounds without much fuss. But
so far it was working with standards-setting bodies rather
than saying, “Hey, you guys, these features will be <em>mine</em>
alone.” I just hoped that in the future Netscape wouldn’t
fashion its software to bind people to specific sources of
news from conglomerates such as Knight-Ridder. Perhaps
half the people cruising the Web were now using Netscape.</p>

<p class='c018'>In a buying spree of its own, America Online purchased
Internet fixtures such as WAIS Inc., the software company.
WAIS had made some of the best publishing tools on the
Net. America Online also bought the WebCrawler, a first-rate
index to the Web. The company acquired Global Net
Navigator, too, the wonderfully Netcentric magazine from
O’Reilly and Associates, a guardian of Net culture. Just like
Frank Daniels III, Tim O’Reilly alluded to the cost of online
services. Explaining the sale, he told a GNN mailing list
that “in order to really do justice to the information problem
GNN was created to solve, GNN would have to be
scaled up beyond our ability to fund it on our own. With
many large players entering the Internet information services
market, the best way to keep our lead was to team
up with one of them.”</p>

<p class='c018'>The most dramatic—and, some critics might say, ominous—alliance
may have happened when MCI teamed up
with Rupert Murdoch to form a new partnership that
could offer many kinds of material on the Net. It committed
as much as $2 billion toward his News Corporation.</p>

<p class='c018'>MCI wasn’t just eager to be a pipeline for publishers
and others—it wanted to Originate Content. The phone
company was already publishing readers’ short stories
electronically by way of Gramercy Press. Soon it would release
a trade paperback—yes, a book on pulped wood—from
a novelist writing under the name of a fictitious
Gramercy author. But the Murdoch alliance meant so
much more. This global entrepreneur controlled Harper-Collins
through News Corps. Would his electronic books
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>enjoy global distribution advantages via MCI’s pipelines,
compared to offerings from smaller, less connected publishers?</p>

<p class='c018'>Within the book business itself, the movement toward
the Net was accelerating as summer 1995 neared. More
and more authors were online, getting feedback from
fans—just as the <a id='corr170.6'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='fledging'>fledgling</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_170.6'><ins class='correction' title='fledging'>fledgling</ins></a></span> rockers of IUMA did. It was a
great morale booster, but only to a point. The novelist
Nicholson Baker, author of the <cite>New Yorker</cite> article on electronic
library catalogues, complained that e-mail had “the
problem of promptitude. You have to answer within four
days or you’re being rude. I like the stateliness of paper,
where you can take six months. You’re still being unforgivably
rude, but somehow it’s okay because other people
have been rude in this way before.”<a id='r4.33' /><a href='#f4.33' class='c022'><sup>[4.33]</sup></a> Obscure writers,
however, found the fan mail from the Internet to be more
helpful. In that way the Net was a <em>friend</em> of diversity.</p>

<p class='c018'>Smaller publishers were also growing more comfortable
with the Internet. Bookport, a California-based service,
let them post their books on the World Wide Web for
Netfolks to read page by page. Alas, a customer could not
obtain a whole e-book at once. The idea, of course, was to
discourage piracy. I disliked the idea of pay-per-read prevailing;
the library model would make books much more
popular among the young and actually <em>help</em> good publishers.
But the Bookport was well done with oodles of
great links to book-related sites on the Web. One of the
first titles was <cite>Netiquette</cite>, a guide to manners on the
Internet; that was in the community-minded spirit of the
traditional Net.</p>

<p class='c018'>Larger publishers, too, pushed ahead on the Web.
Time Warner was selling “Quick Reads.” It was a series of
reference books, self-help guides, and others that you
could download in full and search for, say, the right quote
from a famous business executive (<cite>Bartlett’s Book of
Business Quotations</cite>) or the appropriate recipe (the
<cite>Cooking Library</cite>). I could understand Time Warner’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>fondness here for reference books. Most readers didn’t
want to gawk at electronic novels hour after hour. The big
question, in cases of tech-savvy conglomerates like Time
Warner, was not whether the publishers were ready. It
was whether the <em>public</em> was; whether enough people
would end up soon enough with the proper hardware for
reading books in bed or on the sofa.</p>

<p class='c018'>That, of course, was where TeleRead came in.
Whatever their sizes, publishers needed to hook the
nonelite in this videocentric era before they gave up on
the written word.</p>

<hr class='c032' />

<p class='c018'>The above is not to suggest that text is the only way to
communicate knowledge over the Net. The right graphics
certainly can as well. One of the most intriguing examples
of the potential here is a remarkable endeavor—the
Visible Human Project—in which, so to speak, a murder
lives on forever in cyberspace to the benefit of medical education
and cancer research. I’ll discuss this in the next
chapter.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c017'>Paul Jernigan was a tattooed ex-mechanic just under
six feet tall and weighing 200 pounds. He had been a
drug addict and a chronic drunk, but nearly all his
organs still looked in textbook shape by the standards of
gross anatomy—a stroke of luck that would later help him
win him a macabre competition. Jernigan had fatally
stabbed and shot a seventy-five-year-old watchman after
stealing a radio and a microwave oven. More <a id='corr172.8'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='than decade'>than a decade</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_172.8'><ins class='correction' title='than decade'>than a decade</ins></a></span>
had passed. So had his hopes for a successful appeal to the
courts.</p>

<p class='c018'>Lying on a gurney in a Texas deathhouse—his arms
outstretched, as if in a crucifixion—Paul Jernigan just
gawked upward as his brother watched. No last words
came before the poison flowed into Jernigan’s veins.</p>

<p class='c018'>Jernigan gave himself to science. A not-so-loquacious
sister told me this was to spare the family the cost of burial.
“It was like, matter of fact,” his last attorney said of the
donation. “It was a gift. He wasn’t going to laud himself,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>pat himself on the back. We didn’t send an embossed announcement
that ‘Paul Jernigan has donated his body to
science and this is his ticket to redemption.’”<a id='r5.1' /><a href='#f5.1' class='c022'><sup>[5.1]</sup></a> A former
cellmate offered his own twist. Supposedly, Jernigan
wanted his family to be able to sell his life story for a true-crime
book. The donation just might make the planet care
more about him in death than in life.</p>

<p class='c018'>Within a year of the execution, in fact, I was reading
clips about Paul Jernigan from the <cite>London Times</cite>,
<cite>Jerusalem Post</cite>, <cite>New York Times</cite>, <cite>Washington Post</cite>, <cite>Los
Angeles Times</cite>, and the <cite>Boston Globe</cite>. My favorite lead
came out in a British paper called <cite>The Independent</cite>: “A
killer was yesterday let loose on the Internet computer
network.” I wondered how he’d respond to flaming. The
new Jernigan lived on as a digital atlas of the human
body, a few steaklike cross sections of which I could dial
up on the World Wide Web.</p>

<p class='c018'>The Visible Human Project had come out of the
National Library of Medicine in a Maryland suburb near
Washington, D.C. It was one of the most spectacular examples
of the Net’s potential for spreading knowledge, the
topic of this chapter.</p>

<p class='c018'>Researchers had cut Jernigan into four blocks, frozen
him in a blue gel, ground him down millimeter by millimeter,
digitally photographed the 1,878 cross sections
that emerged, scanned these slices<a id='r5.2' /><a href='#f5.2' class='c022'><sup>[5.2]</sup></a> into a computer, put
them on magnetic tape, and then on the Internet. Now the
cadaver would be grist for medical educators and cancer
researchers and perhaps even the designers of a “Fantastic
Voyage”-style game. Players might explore the human
body from the inside, just as Isaac Asimov’s characters did
in his novel. The government itself was spending $1.4 million
on the project; expected commercial payoffs could
reach the tens of millions and maybe more. Research and
education, however, would be paramount here.</p>

<p class='c018'>The Visible Human Project is but one of thousands of
uses that academics and researchers have found for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>Internet. The Net is why many scientific luminaries were
quick to slap the “fraud” label on efforts to create energy
through cold fusion. Skeptics throughout the world could
compare notes. If Paris couldn’t replicate an experiment,
then Boston would know within hours. Working in the
other direction, fusion stalwarts have used the Internet to
swap data and maintain the faith. Cyberspace is to knowledge
what beehives are to honey.</p>

<p class='c018'>Already the Net teems with thousands of mailing lists
devoted to the most arcane disciplines, not just to the
mainstream ones. Many scientists and other researchers
envision the Net as a substitute for paper-style academic
journals, subscriptions to some of which can cost as much
as a Ford Escort. Stevan Harnad has caught the imaginations
of many academics with “A Subversive Proposal” for
scholars to publish their finished works formally on the
Net without offering them to academic publishers. He
puts out a vigilantly edited, psychology-related magazine
with a circulation of tens of thousand on the Internet; he
sees no reason for the Net just to be a repository for pre-publication
papers. In his opinion, academics could use
such opportunities to enjoy greater bargaining power
with existing publishers.</p>

<p class='c018'>Yet another glory of the Internet is that it serves as a
bridge between experts and nonexperts, as well as one between
authorities in many academic disciplines. A dean of
a law school, for example, can sign up for mailing lists on
electronic serials to learn more about the technology that
is fueling the drive for copyright reform.</p>

<p class='c018'>From Day One, the Internet was a creature of the elite
research establishment, but knowledge-related uses have
steadily grown more egalitarian—starting with the brightest
students in elementary and high schools, then moving
on to average children, and even to problem kids.</p>

<p class='c018'>To dispose of a major issue, No, the Net shouldn’t replace
teachers. I couldn’t agree more with Cliff Stoll when
he rants against lax standards and mindless technocratic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>schemes. Well-trained teachers can provide inspiration
and guidance to help children explore networks on their
own. The last thing we need is to turn the educational
reaches of the Net into one big flash card. What the Net
can do is prepare children to deal with source material,
with actual papers written by researchers, as opposed to
pabulum in textbooks.</p>

<p class='c018'>Correctly, Stoll criticizes some educators for teaching
astronomy without children studying the actual sky; computer
programs should only supplement such activities,
not replace them. But shouldn’t he apply the same “real
thing” logic to Web-distributed source material and applaud
students’ easier access to it? Only the brightest
children will benefit from a complicated mathematical
treatise. But surely even an average student could take advantage
of a historian’s paper on a nearby Civil War battle.
If anything, teachers could use the Web and other areas of
the Net to demand <em>more</em> research from students. Just why
must Stoll compare the Net to a fun but dumb educational
film? Is a Web version of the <cite>Odyssey</cite> to be confused with
some educational Looney Tunes?</p>

<p class='c018'>Intriguingly, Web technology makes it possible for
students to produce information, not just soak it up. In
Fairfax County, Virginia, students at Thomas Jefferson, a
high school for the gifted, are posting their “pages” on the
World Wide Web. I can remember when college applicants
submitted tape recordings of their music. Now they
can also give M.I.T. or Caltech the addresses of their Web
pages and demonstrate, in the most direct way, their familiarity
with networking. They can post their papers
and point to other people’s pages that interest them.</p>

<p class='c018'>Also, at Jefferson and countless other schools, students
can electronically send their classmates to knowledge-rich
sites on the Web. Clicking on “NASA” in blue
letters within Bob’s area, Jill can see what the space program
is doing. Then she can return, click on other blue
letters, and check out his tip to visit a history-related site
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>discussing the Sputnik and Vanguard days. Via a project
called MendelWeb, Ellen can read the famous treatise of
Gregor Mendel, the geneticist, and retrieve other scientists’
opinions; then she might write her own paper and
post it on the Web for classmates and even for students
elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c018'>Clearly the value of the Net, for students and researchers
alike, isn’t just in the information per se—it’s
also in the ease of sharing it. Teachers can point to common
Web resources (such as MendelWeb) from Web
pages where they add their own comment, or even their
own study guides. They can also link to other guides.</p>

<p class='c018'>Some Web sites even offer electronic forms with questions
to which students can respond—in either a multiple
choice or an essay format. Andy Carvin, a specialist in educational
technology with the Corporation for Public
Broadcasting, praises the World Wide Web as “an excellent
tool in which to design online curricula.” Understandably,
even elementary schools are getting on the
Web with their own areas.</p>

<p class='c018'>Other good things are happening. By way of a project
called Big Sky Telegraph, Native Americans in Montana
have been pen pals with children in the former Soviet
Union. What better way to stir up an interest in writing,
politics, and geography at the same time? Significantly, in
Montana and other places, many schools are not on the
Net directly. Instead, schools use affordable bulletin board
systems—their own or perhaps those operated by hobbyists—which
can relay Net-originated material. If need be,
such systems can run on ancient computers of the kind
found at garage sales; some messages may be delayed for
days, but that’s better than no connection at all. Within the
BBS world, moreover, nets even exist especially for education.
Consider K12Net, which includes at least “three
dozen conferences specifically related to K-12 curriculum”
and reaches some sixty school-associated systems in New
Zealand alone. More and more, however, lucky schools
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>are hooking into the Internet directly or at least arranging
for teachers and students to get accounts elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c018'>As a ninth grader at Poolesville Middle Senior High
School, in Poolesville, Maryland, Chris Gazunis used the
Net to study catastrophes such as earthquakes, hurricanes,
and oil spills. “We didn’t just look at a textbook diagram
of what caused an earthquake and the casualty
number associated with it,” he recalled. “We used the networks
to learn what happened to the people’s lives and
homes. Instead of just being given a set of directions and
material that would result in an earthquake resistant
building, we designed and tested them ourselves.”<a id='r5.3' /><a href='#f5.3' class='c022'><sup>[5.3]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c018'>Randy Hammer, a high schooler at Timberline High
School in Lacey, Washington, who is blind “with two glass
eyes,” once had to have sighted people read the newspaper
to him. No longer. Via network connections, he can enjoy
the <cite>Washington Post</cite>, the <cite>Moscow News</cite>, and science-oriented
publications—thanks to a gadget that reads aloud to
him the words on his screen. “It’s hard now,” he wrote, “to
remember how I lived without this wealth of materials and
information at my fingertips.”<a id='r5.4' /><a href='#f5.4' class='c022'><sup>[5.4]</sup></a> That’s what happens when
the hardware is around.</p>

<p class='c018'>Even in a wealthy place like the United States, however,
society so far has been stingy toward high tech in
public schools. The ratio between students and computers
is something like 16 to 1. Some 75 percent of American
schools have computers capable of getting on the Net, but
the children can’t all use them at once. What’s more, just
35 percent of public schools have Internet hookups in
classrooms, media centers, or computer labs. Only 3 percent
of the classrooms themselves are wired in, according
to a survey from the U.S. Department of Education.</p>

<p class='c018'>We’re talking almost Third World here. “It’s amazing
to me how people outside of education have no idea how
teachers still have to line up outside the teachers’ lounge
to use the telephone,” says a senior analyst at the
Congressional Office of Technology Assessment.<a id='r5.5' /><a href='#f5.5' class='c022'><sup>[5.5]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>In the end, as I see it, the real solution is a TeleRead-style
program of the kind described in the previous chapter.
It would connect the students to the nets from home, reduce
the future communications costs of the schools somewhat,
and allow students to explore computer networks at
leisure rather than just during the school day. A few small
steps are already being taken in this general direction. The
state of Maryland has granted limited—but free—Internet
privileges to school children and other residents. Without
leaving home, they can dial up material ranging from
weather reports, to academic papers, to Shakespearean poetry.
Joseph Peightel, a cable splicer with Bell Atlantic, says
that the Sailor program is just the ticket for his ten-year-old
daughter, whose hunger for books outstrips the family budget.
While the Peightels can’t retrieve the latest best-sellers,
they at least can enjoy Project Gutenberg-style material in
the public domain. The Maryland program helping the
Peightels is not TeleRead, and it comes with problems and
inefficiencies, but it may be as close as any state effort to the
nirvana envisioned by Al Gore, in which all children could
dial up the Library of Congress.</p>

<p class='c018'>Needless to say, I bristle when Cliff Stoll glosses over the
reasons why the Net can’t provide easy answers to questions
such as “What political compromises caused Bismarck to
become the capital of North Dakota?” or “Why isn’t Kyoto
the capital of today’s Japan?” or “What’s the history of the
Ruhr Valley, and what are the implications of its new
Eastern European competition?” Of course. Worried about
piracy, publishers have understandably kept their textbooks
off the Net. The last laugh, however, just may be on the more
zealous of the copyright interests. Right now Stoll couldn’t
be more correct about the need for more and better books
on the Net; but as shown by, say, MendelWeb, the academic
community is doing plenty on its own. And if this keeps up,
the demand for copyrighted, commercial books, the kind
that feed me, my editors, and yes, my publishers, too, could
suffer. Far better to have a national digital library with privately
originated books available from the very start.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>Ahead I’ll examine more closely some scientific and
educational uses of the Net. Selections—yes, the print
kind, not the Jernigan variety—will appear on:</p>

<p class='c025'>• The “hows,” the positives, and the negatives of the
Visible Human Project—it stands out for reasons beyond
the drama. The Clinton administration has encouraged
high-bandwidth, scientific users of the Net. The original
Visible Man requires sixteen gigabytes of storage—enough
space to hold fifty <cite>Encyclopaedia Britannica</cite>s.
Some say this isn’t the best use of Net resources. I disagree,
however, and I’ll tell why. Along the way I’ll pass
on information about the Internet’s Visible Man before
he became so visible.</p>

<p class='c025'>• High school use of the Internet. The United States is
hardly the only nation with thousands of children in cyberspace—countries
ranging from Canada to Singapore
are putting students online, directly or indirectly. Significantly,
computers and networks can help students
outside the elite. Some proof of this comes from Nova
Scotia, where, for several years, a high school has been
using the Internet to benefit some “at-risk” students. I’ll
tell you about the Internet success that a Canadian
teacher named Jeff Doran has enjoyed with leather-jacketed
teenagers. Many are racing into the computer
lab and, let’s hope, away from fates such as Paul
Jernigan’s. The Internet project at Park View Education
Centre is far from an unqualified triumph—many Park
View teachers still fear the technology—but patterns
there suggest a vast potential for educational uses of the
Net if schools will modernize their curricula.</p>

<div class='textbox1'>

<p class='c018'>The Visible Man</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>The doctor, a Scottish-accented man in his fifties or sixties,
had collected a wall full of diplomas and plaques.
Perhaps that’s why he felt entitled to give only the sketchiest
of explanations when he told a Midwestern friend of mine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>that she might need heart surgery to avoid a possible
stroke. Karen* would be in the hospital just a day or so. But
during this time a surgeon would insert a catheter up her
groin and go on to kill off selected heart cells. With luck, the
operation would end her atrial fibrillation. It had made her
heart throb as quickly as 200 beats a minute on occasion
and had sent her to the emergency room.</p>

<p class='c018'>Karen pressed for details about the recommended operation.
“Ma’am,” Dr. S. said in a peremptory burr, “this is
too technical.”</p>

<p class='c018'>It was Valentine’s Day and Karen and her husband
would rather have been thinking about hearts in that way
alone. But she wanted to know all. “Ma’am, I’ll draw you a
picture,” Dr. S. said a bit grudgingly. The doctor sketched a
crude heart that might as well have been on a greeting card.
Hastily drawn lines showed how electric impulses were
traveling through Karen’s heart with an extra path. The operation
would cut off the surplus wiring, so to speak.</p>

<p class='c018'>Well, this was a start. But Karen still felt ignorant, and
it was <em>her</em> body into which the catheter would go. And so it
is with many patients, not all, but many. Even good doctors
don’t always tell enough.</p>

<p class='c018'>The Visible Human Project, however, would make it
easier for Karen to learn more. Dr. S. could have shown
Karen a computer image of an actual human heart and
have pointed to the exact areas that the surgeon would kill
off. Karen would have picked up a better appreciation of
the complexities of the proposed operation. At the same
time, Dr. S. could also have juggled around computer images
to show the increased risk of clotting that would result
if she <em>failed</em> to have the operation. Karen would have
emerged better informed and more confident—or less,
whatever the facts justified. Someday she might even be
able to dial up on the Internet an animated, perfectly detailed
series of pictures of the operation.</p>

<p class='c018'>That was what the Visible Human Project would
mean. What’s more, patient education was just one of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>many uses; the right technology could revolutionize the
training of doctors and advance medical research.</p>

<p class='c018'>As far back as the 1980s, such ideas intrigued Michael
Ackerman, a Ph.D. in biomedical engineering who worked
for the National Library of Medicine, part of the National
Institutes of Health. He heard of a project at the University
of Washington that was digitizing the human brain, although
not the entire body. Researchers at other schools
hoped to do the same with other organs. But they were
less keen on collecting images and other data than on
using <a id='corr181.11'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='the them'>them</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_181.11'><ins class='correction' title='the them'>them</ins></a></span>, so why duplicate each other? Like the
Internet itself, then, just one digitized corpse could help
many researchers at once.</p>

<p class='c018'>In North Carolina a marketing executive with a drug
company was dreaming of a human atlas on a computer
screen. Why should medical students have to make do
with fold-out drawings in anatomy guides? Michael Du
Toit, Vice President of marketing for Glaxo Inc., passed the
idea on to a small company called Butler Communications,
which checked out the technology. Glaxo had
three goals. First, it wanted to create the basic images.
Second, it wanted viewers to be able to wander through
the body; ideally they could move the body for the best
view, spin it, travel through it. And third, it wanted researchers
to be able to give the lungs cancer, clog the arteries
to the heart, and demonstrate the effects of drugs.
But computers weren’t ready. “The hype versus the deliverable,”
Robert Butler told me, “was miles and miles
apart.” To meet Glaxo’s specs—to show the body by way of
artistic recreations and virtual reality—might cost as
much as $100 million.</p>

<p class='c018'>Imagine the excitement that Du Toit and Butler must
have felt on learning that academic and government researchers
were finally coming up with the means for this to
happen at a fraction of the expense. The Feds put out a request
for proposals for the dissection job, and the crew at the
University of Colorado made the final cut. Still unanswered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>was the question of whose corpse would end up on the
Internet. The contest judges allowed a bit more leeway than
did the people choosing Miss America and Mr. Universe.</p>

<p class='c018'>The ideal candidate for Visibility could be anywhere
from maybe thirty to sixty years of age and be a bit thin or
pudgy, albeit not exceedingly so. Height mustn’t go too far
beyond the norms for male and female. Above all, the innards
of the body had to be photogenic from an anatomical
perspective. That weeded out anyone worn down by
cancer or similar disease, not to mention any victims of
automobile accidents or knifings.</p>

<p class='c018'>A little unfairly, this contest had geographical limits.
Texas, Maryland, and Colorado were the states with subcontracts
to provide the body. I could understand Maryland
and Colorado, but Texas? I wondered if the reason would be
the fondness of the people down there for capital punishment.
No longer did bodies have to roast in electric chairs.
Texas helpfully killed its murderers with lethal injections.
So, in this competition, Paul Jernigan was a strong contender
from the beginning.</p>

<p class='c018'>Murder is an act of the will no matter how poor or
Hitlerian our parents are, or what genes shape us and our
brains. But if Fate sent anyone to the deathhouse gurney
and to Visible Manhood, it was Paul Jernigan. He lived out
an updated Dreiser novel.</p>

<p class='c018'>His full legal name was Joseph Paul Jernigan, and he
was born in Geneva, Illinois, on January 31, 1954, the
youngest of Earl Jernigan’s six children. The boy suffered
from asthma and almost died of it. He and his brothers
and sisters typically owned just one pair of jeans each.
Their mother eked it out in a chicken-processing plant, as
a clerk at Montgomery Wards, and at other low-paying
jobs, and they lived in public housing. She married a truck
driver who, like Earl, was a strict disciplinarian toward
the children. Later she suffered a stroke. Afflicted with a
learning disorder, Paul flunked a grade at school and
dropped out two years before graduating. He was a drunk
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>and eventually was doing a pharmacy’s worth of drugs,
from Quaaludes to horse tranquilizers.</p>

<p class='c018'>The Army trained Paul Jernigan as a mechanic, sent
him to Germany, then tossed him out as unsalvageable.
Perhaps recognizing the cruel matrix that shaped
Jernigan, it gave him a general discharge (a “no comment”
in effect) rather than a dishonorable one. A shrink
later found Jernigan to be a passive-aggressive man who
was sometimes TNT-volatile. In the years after the military
Jernigan kept a cooler of ice and beer in his automobile;
a typical paycheck went for pot, cheeseburgers, and
enough octane for himself and the car.</p>

<p class='c018'>Paradoxically, though, friends trusted Paul Jernigan
with their children. Jernigan was the perfect baby-sitter
who enjoyed romping around with his charges. He married
for a stretch and loved his stepchildren.</p>

<p class='c018'>But he failed at marriage just as he had failed in
school and in the Army.</p>

<p class='c018'>Jernigan bungled at burglary, too. He was already a
two-time loser in 1981 when he and a pal named Roy
Lamb were driving down the road in Corsicana, Texas, a
small, howdy-neighbor kind of town south of Dallas on
Interstate 45. Emboldened by a night of booze and pot, the
two decided to rob Edward Hale’s house. They began
stuffing their loot into a pillow case when Hale surprised
them. Lamb ran out. Jernigan beat Hale over the head
with an ashtray, hoping to kill off the witness. Hale stubbornly
survived. Then Jernigan stabbed him with a rusty,
dull-bladed meat knife, which just bent on Hale’s chest.
And so he took a shotgun and fired until the watchman
was dead. Edward Hale did not die painlessly.</p>

<p class='c018'>After the murder, Jernigan went to Houston to try to
straighten out his life. He was in a halfway house when
arrested.</p>

<p class='c018'>Some would say Jernigan needn’t have wound up on
the gurney; the law prevented the courts from accepting an
accomplice’s testimony. Mark Ticer, his last attorney,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>believes that Jernigan may have felt so contrite that he
wanted to die. Ticer grew truly fond of his client. In character,
Jernigan would constantly inquire about the lawyer’s
two-year-old and remember birthdays.</p>

<p class='c018'>Jernigan gave Ticer’s wife, Cecily, some earrings
made from gold bought with his military pension, and he
crafted a wishing-well bucket for Ticer. Ticer was as trusting
of the murderer as Jernigan’s friends had been; he
would have trusted him with his own young daughter.
Even on death row Jernigan would write to the stepchildren
from his failed marriage.</p>

<p class='c018'>Smoking a hand-rolled cigarette and sipping a Pepsi,
he would discuss legal strategy with Ticer until finally
there wasn’t quite so much to be strategic about.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Paul,” Ticer more or less said, “things are not going
well. I guess I have to talk about your burial arrangements
if they’re going to execute you. I know your family doesn’t
have a lot of money.” And it was there in the Ellis prison in
Huntsville that Ticer learned of The Gift. Neither knew
Jernigan would eventually become the Visible Man.</p>

<p class='c018'>Mark Ticer tried for a stay of execution up to the last
minute. Aware of Ticer’s devotion to him, Jernigan asked
his lawyer not to witness his last minutes. Death was almost
instant. Paul Jernigan died much more smoothly
than he had lived.</p>

<p class='c018'>The state anatomical board, a subcontractor of the
University of Colorado, took it from there. Jernigan got
one and a half gallons of 1 percent formalin. That was a
light touch. Often cadavers are embalmed with ten gallons
of a stronger preservative, and they sit and pickle for a
year, so that when medical students cut them up all the
tissues are gray. But the idea here, in case Jernigan won
the Visible Man honors, was to keep his tissue looking
nice and bright like prime meat; the students would be
able to enjoy a better, more realistic view.</p>

<p class='c018'>Writing this chapter, I pondered the use of the state
anatomical board as a cadaver procurer. Thank God the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>board was separate from the court system. Given the rage
for businesslike government, I could just imagine some
of the wilder politicians setting up an execution quota to
work toward a balanced state budget. But the real reason
for the use of Jernigan’s corpse was more prosaic. Texas
had one of the best cadaver-donation programs in the
country, and of some 2,000 bodies that year, his just
happened to show up at the right time and in the right
condition.</p>

<p class='c018'>A Learjet flew Jernigan from Texas to Colorado. Awaiting
him were the masterminds of the dissection effort at
the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in
Denver. Victor Spitzer specialized in radiology and cellular
and structural biology; David Whitlock was a professor
of cellular and structural biology. The people working
most on Jernigan would be the research assistants in the
dissection room, which, day to day, was overseen by Tim
Butzer, thirty, and his wife, Martha Pelster, a bright, curly-haired
woman of twenty-five who would later apply for
medical school. Helen Pelster, another assistant, was the
sister of Martha Pelster.<a id='r5.6' /><a href='#f5.6' class='c022'><sup>[5.6]</sup></a> The whole scenario—the family
connection—begged for embellishment from Stephen
King or Robin Cook.</p>

<p class='c018'>I asked Martha Pelster if her work haunted her at
night. “I kind of keep it on a pretty even level,” she said. “I
don’t have too much trouble with it.”<a id='r5.7' /><a href='#f5.7' class='c022'><sup>[5.7]</sup></a> She said Butzer felt
the same.</p>

<p class='c018'>Had Jernigan inspired much after-hours talk with her
husband?</p>

<p class='c018'>“If there was a problem that needed to be worked out.”</p>

<p class='c018'>But did Pelster and Butzer reflect on the Visible Man’s
past in relation to what was happening now?</p>

<p class='c018'>“Not too much. Getting emotionally involved with
something like that—you don’t want to discuss it. It isn’t
relevant to what we’re doing.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Inquiring about the university’s most famous cadaver,
I learned that Jernigan had come with at least two tattoos
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>on his chest area; they looked vaguely like dragons. His
build and muscles were impressive. The lab had to modify
some of the machinery to handle Jernigan. He showed
up with just one testicle, which, I learned elsewhere, was
the aftermath of painful surgery from his military days. I
also heard that another operation had left him without an
appendix. Students and researchers seeking to unravel the
mysteries of appendixdom would just have to turn elsewhere.
As a taxpayer, however, I didn’t feel cheated. This
was the States, not Bangladesh; did that many Americans
die without any remnants of surgery? Jernigan’s cadaver
stood head and shoulders above a rival, a woman who
was a chronic alcoholic with visible damage to her liver.
In the hierarchy of the dissection room livers must have
counted more than appendixes.</p>

<p class='c018'>Before the millimeter-by-millimeter grinding, the scientists
treated Jernigan to magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI, mixing radio waves and magnetic fields) and
computer-aided tomography (CAT or CT, which is like
topography except that it’s on the innards of the human
body). MRI picks up soft tissue. CAT scans are good for
hard tissue, and for the differences between it and soft tissue.
The researchers CT’ed Jernigan both before and after
he was frozen, and these scans had to correspond with the
alignment of the digitized photographs. Imagine the precision
required here.</p>

<p class='c018'>Preparing to slice the icy cadaver into four blocks for
convenient grinding, the lab crew sharpened up on a less
exalted cadaver. Vertebrae were a problem. “This saw
would curve,” Pelster said, “so you wouldn’t have a perfect
perpendicular flat cut. It would have a curve to it. So we
took the cadaver back to the CT scanner and found the
level where we could make a cut.” In the end there were
three cuts and four sections of Jernigan—head and torso,
abdomen and pelvis just down to the thighs, the rest of the
thighs and the knees, and just below the knees to the feet.
The frozen pieces went into an aluminum mold, one at a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>time. And then the researchers poured a blue gel around
them (the same blue you’ll see on the edges of the cross
sections if you dial them up on the World Wide Web). The
result was four chunks of ice, each approximately 20 by
20 by 15 inches.</p>

<p class='c018'>The grinding area was the next stop. Plexiglass enclosed
it. That was a must. Pieces of cadaver would fly
everywhere as science turned Paul Jernigan into dust
with a spinning, carbide-tipped blade. “You’d think we’d
have trouble sectioning bone,” Pelster said, “but that’s not
been the case. Bone always cuts very clean. But sometimes
we have a lot of trouble with the tendons. The tendons
are such that they don’t want to shear off cleanly,
and so a lot of time we did hand scalpel work on each
slice. So the slices might take ten minutes each instead of
four minutes each.” Actually the time varied. “Ninety
slices were the most we cut on any one day, and we averaged
sixty. Sometimes it was ten a day. It was about four
months of sectioning.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Were you worried about damaging the goods?” I
asked.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Definitely. We just did the best we could.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Any near misses?”</p>

<p class='c018'>“There were definitely a few. We never were to the
point where we torpedoed the whole project. It would be
more a possibility of losing a slice. We never came close to
botching the whole thing. You look back and you see a little
dot of ice here or there, things like that. You do the best
you can. But I think it turned out well.”</p>

<p class='c018'>All along, of course, cameras and lights were clicking
and flashing away. The slices went into a black-walled, reflection-proof
chamber for photographing by one digital
camera and two with film. A table held the cameras. It
turned to give each a view of the cross sections from the
same angle. The results went into a Macintosh Quadra
840AV with 128 megabytes of random access memory and
2 gigabytes of hard disk space. It was, in other words,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>many times more powerful and could store at least several
times more than the average personal computer. As with
the grinding, problems sometimes arose. “You think computers
are so precise,” Martha Pelster said, “but they’re
not. Things are always going wrong.” Typically working
with her and Tim were such people as the man who kept
the grinding machine running, a camera expert, and a
computer expert (Helen Pelster, Martha’s sister), who
would transfer the digitized Jernigan to tape and CD-ROM.
Come the end of a hard day of photography, the lab
crew collected everything and put it back in the freezer.
“And then when we were finished doing this,” Pelster said,
“we had many bags of things that needed to go be cremated.”
The dust went to a contractor for incineration.</p>

<p class='c018'>Digitized photos and CAT and MRI images from
Jernigan went to National Library of Medicine in Maryland
and to the Scientific Computing Division at the National
Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado.
The latter worked with a Cray Y-MP/8 supercomputer and
Silicon Graphics workstations to study the results. A headline
on the World Wide Web summed up the magnitude of
the computational task: “The Visible Human Project: Can
It Bring a Supercomputer to Its Knees?” A machine with
the power of the Cray could take the 1,878 cross sections,
stack them like slices of an upright bread loaf, and create
electronic bones or hearts or brains that looked as if they
had never been taken apart in the first place.</p>

<p class='c018'>By fall 1994, Michael Ackerman at the National
Library of Medicine was ready to tell the world about the
electronic Jernigan and to have his images posted on the
Net by way of the weather forecaster’s facilities. “We hold
this out as an example of the future of health care,”
Ackerman said. He predicted that the study of medicine
would become increasingly visual. No one talked then of a
murderer, and so the first stories on the wire services
blandly mentioned an anonymous thirty-nine-year-old
donor from Texas who had died of a drug overdose.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>Learning that a digitized corpse would go on the
Internet, not everyone greeted the news with unalloyed
praise. Some reviled this as a waste of Net resources. Why
not use CD-ROMs to distribute the information? To an extent
I could see their arguments. The Library was releasing
sixteen gigabytes of images at the start, and even
someone with a deluxe Net connection could spend a
week or so downloading it. Critics believed that this
squandered bandwidth, that it was a bit like cruising
down a narrow country road with an overgrown tour bus
and fifty cars honking at it from behind. The strain on the
Internet was far from that bad. But even by Net standards
this was indeed a behemoth, and much more importantly,
the bandwidth defenders worried about the precedent
being set here. Sixteen gigabytes of images was equivalent
to 8 billion pages of double-spaced typing. Individual
e-mail messages commonly took up only a page or two.</p>

<p class='c018'>Even so, the Visible Man had his friends out there in
cyberspace. Anxious to beat rivals to the data, one company
kept its modems pumping away for a week until it
had received all of Jernigan. It didn’t want to wait weeks or
months for tapes. Thanks to the Net, many people throughout
the world could receive Jernigan at the same time. In
the first few months of the release, more than 900 companies,
schools, and people wrote Ackerman about licenses
giving them permission to use the data in experiments and
products. Some 100 actually followed through—everyone
from pharmaceutical firms to a young artist who, according
to Ackerman, assured him that she would make tasteful
use of the images.</p>

<p class='c018'>Luckily from a bandwidth perspective, you didn’t have
to download all of Jernigan. Each slice was a mere seven
megabytes in a spatial resolution of 2,048 by 1,216 pixels
(several times sharper than that of a typical personal computer).
A maker of software for ophthalmologists could
pull down only the images dealing with the eye and related
brain areas. Those aiming for the podiatry market
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>could focus on the feet and ankles. What’s more, even
without a license, ordinary Net users could dial up
Jernigan Lite, so to speak, from the World Wide Web.</p>

<p class='c018'>Coming over the Net eventually would be more than
just the raw, unprocessed images. Refined versions—for
example, animated Jernigans, rotating in 3-D, or even virtual
reality versions—could go anywhere in the world.
And when they did, researchers and students would be
wanting their own pet views. CD-ROMs just didn’t store
enough data to anticipate all the possibilities. Typically
they could hold maybe 650 megabytes of data. Even extended,
the storage would offer a fraction of what could be
available via high-speed connections to sites from Paris to
Melbourne.</p>

<p class='c018'>Jernigan, you might say, was more than just the material
for a medical experiment. He was also a focus of a research
project to develop special formats for libraries of
visual information on the Net. Eventually people would be
able to download not just images but also the “objects”
that made up the images.</p>

<p class='c018'>“These objects will have knowledge in them,” Michael
Ackerman said, “so they know how they relate to each
other and the rest of the scheme. Say you ask for the heart.
What you get of course is the not a picture of the heart but
the objects that made up the heart that your software has
now rendered as the heart. If you point to something on
the heart, it can open up because it’s made up of these objects.
And if you point to something on the margin of the
heart and say “What is attached here?” that object on the
margin knows what its nearest neighbor is even though
it’s not in the picture. And it knows to go back to the database
and bring up what’s attached to it.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Such an approach might even take advantage of Web-style
technology to link together libraries at a number of
locations. So you might smoothly travel from, say, a
processed image of a blood vessel done up at School X to
an animated image of a heart as tweaked by Company Y.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>Those uses would increase the load on the Internet, of
course. But ultimately the principle of the expanding
pipeline might work to the benefit of all. That is, the heavier
the traffic on the Net, the heftier the connections would
be built. So in the end, everything would be cheaper—from
image transmissions to sending one-page notes by
electronic mail. The challenge, of course, was for this to
happen without the costs of ordinary Net users being driven
up by the workload that the image libraries and similar
endeavors would bring about. That’s where TeleRead
might come in. It could systematically promote the mass
use of electronic forms for tax documents, business transactions,
and other purposes. And indirectly the money
saved on paperwork could go not only toward a national
library but also to help upgrade the present Internet for
researchers and the world at large.</p>

<p class='c018'>Right now people tended to see the applications of the
Net in terms of one use versus another—in terms of money
for low-cost networks for consumer education versus
high-bandwidth connections of the kind that Ackerman
wanted. With a TeleRead-style approach and enough
imagination, however, we could take full advantage of the
economies of the technology. And so although we would
not end the clashes between Net users with different priorities,
we could at least reduce them.</p>

<p class='c018'>Several other cost-related questions arose beyond
those of the expense of the network connections. I wondered
how much patients would be charged to see a picture
of the innards of Jernigan or a Visible Woman. Robert
Butler doubted that his client, Glaxo, was ready to say.
However, he left me with the impression that this probably
would not be pay per view. Glaxo had its own reasons
for going ahead—for example, showing doctors the effects
of its pharmaceuticals on the body. So, no, he said, this
was not a plot to gouge the public with peep shows.</p>

<p class='c018'>A related issue, arising from the involvement of drug
companies, was the question of proprietary information.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>While the images were on the Internet for all to see, this
project was not entirely in the spirit of the Net’s openness.
Butler, for example, might have feared that I was working
for a rival corporation, and he waited several weeks to return
my calls. I could understand his reasons. Still, I was
startled to learn that Ackerman at the National Institutes
of Health would not even release to me a list of the companies
that had licensed the use of the images. Nor had NIH
organized a newsgroup or a mailing list. Surely all the
hundreds of licensees would have common problems,
common opportunities, that they could discuss without
imperiling each other’s projects.</p>

<p class='c018'>Yet another question went back to one of the main reasons
given for the project. Could medical students really
learn by hooking into the Net and dialing up the images
from the Visible Man? David Dean should have been a
complete booster of this endeavor. He was, after all, a Ph.D.
who worked in medical imaging and taught anatomy at
Case Western Reserve University. And yet he told me, “I
feel you can’t replicate the experience in the anatomy lab.
Students will have no time for this stuff. They’re totally
overwhelmed. They can see the same structures again and
again in different bodies.”</p>

<p class='c018'>At the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill,
Gerry Oxford, professor of physiology, said that seeing organs
in three dimensions wasn’t the same as <em>feeling</em> them.
“Physicians in training need a visceral appreciation of the
fact that they will have responsibility for the human body.”
Even a believer in the project, Marc Nelson, assistant dean
of medical education at the Stanford University School of
Medicine in Palo Alto, worried that electronic anatomy
could lessen contacts between students and teachers.<a id='r5.8' /><a href='#f5.8' class='c022'><sup>[5.8]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c018'>Real bodies, however, cost universities $600 each—assuming
they could get them in the first place. And students
would not have eyeballs, hearts, hands, and livers to
themselves.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>Of all the boosters of the project, Martha Pelster may
have been the most persuasive. She worked as a lab assistant,
had cut up dozens of bodies, and now was headed to
medical school. “When you look at this cadaver,” Pelster
said of the digitized Jernigan, “everything is still in its orientation.
When you go in and dissect, you take a lot of stuff
out. If you cut something wrong or cut through something
and toss the object into the reject bin, you’ve lost it. But
with this visible male, you can go back in again. You can
see what happened before your lab partner went in there
and messed up your cadaver. This cross-sectional
anatomy is going to be the be-all and end-all. A book can’t
have this many cross sections, this good.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Just as important, no one in the project, from
Ackerman to Pelster, was touting electronic cadavers as a
complete substitute for the real ones that the medical students
studied. The digitized versions would simply augment
the real cadavers, the ones that you couldn’t reboot if
you cut them the wrong way. In the new era, medical
schools could even require students to put the human
body together, not just take it apart.</p>

<p class='c018'>Cadavers in cyberspace would offer yet another advantage:
even schoolchildren could study them. People for the
Ethical Treatment of Animals and some rock-n-roll musicians
such as Pearl Jam were asking schools to “cut out
dissection” and use computer imaging or model frogs.
Thanks to the Visible Human Project, however, students
someday would do better than just viewing pixels flashing
across the screen. They would be able to tour the body of
an actual human. Potential medical students, moreover,
could get a head start. Long before they reached the slicing
rooms, they would be familiar with electronic cadavers
and be able to make better use of the real ones. What’s
more, the digitized Jernigan could revolutionize training
in laparoscopic surgery, where doctors inserted tubes in
patients and operated with tiny instruments and TV-like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>monitors and cameras. The view on the video screen of a
training computer could be true to life.</p>

<p class='c018'>All this was not even to mention other applications—for
example, computer-simulated crash tests to improve
auto safety, efforts to study the range of wrist motion and
reduce carpal tunnel syndrome in typists, or investigations
of ways to protect athletes against injuries.</p>

<p class='c018'>I asked Mark Ticer if Jernigan’s family had ever
thought of suing for any of the wealth that the project
might create from medical products and the rest.</p>

<p class='c018'>The answer pleased me in this litigious era. Ticer said
that if anything the family would be offended that anyone
raised the issue. That was the way Jernigan and his kin
were. “There wasn’t a condition attached to his gift,”
Ticer said.</p>

<p class='c018'>Sharon Kuster, Jernigan’s sister, said her brother
would “probably be happy about it. I am.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Now he can be remembered for all the good he did
rather than all the evil,” Ticer said. “I think he’d be quietly
delighted.” I picked up on the “quietly.” Jernigan’s invisibility,
prior to his crimes, was not just because of his station
or lack of station in life. That was his way. Many other
inmates on death row gravitated toward microphones.
Jernigan spurned them. The true crime book, if one ever
resulted, would never have come out while he was walking
and breathing.</p>

<p class='c018'>Shortly after I talked to Mark Ticer and Sharon Kuster,
my friend Karen got the results of an intensive examination
by a second doctor. It seemed that Karen would not be
undergoing the heart surgery. But even now she couldn’t
tell for sure. What’s more, if Karen received drugs instead,
the medical benefits of the Visible Man might still help her
someday; a major pharmaceutical company, after all, was
hoping to use the digitized cadaver as a tool to explore and
demonstrate the effects of its products.</p>

<p class='c018'>My thoughts shifted back to Jernigan the human.
Lying on the death gurney, awaiting the poison, would he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>have wanted to make The Gift if someone had rushed in
and asked at the last minute, “Do you realize you’ll be all
over the Internet? That you’ll suffer the ultimate invasion
of privacy? That strangers from here to Oslo will see your
guts?” I’d like to think that Jernigan would have nodded
and the Learjet would still have flown the body up to
Denver. For the sake of Karen, of other sick people, of
those who just might live longer and better if their surgeons
were slightly more skilled, or if they themselves
could make the right decisions about their medical care—for
the sake of them all, I was not-so-quietly delighted that
the invisible man was now visible.</p>

<div class='textbox1 width75'>

<p class='c018'>Schools: Park View Educational Centre</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>The big motto out of the United States, in the 1990s,
seemed to be, “Build jail cells, not classrooms.” Again and
again, politicians would promise to shrink the bloat in
school budgets while Fighting Crime; I shared some of
their skepticism toward the edutocracy. Washington, D.C.,
was Exhibit A here. In one recent year the city had shelled
out half a billion on public schools but paid just $2 million
for books.</p>

<p class='c018'>Suppose, however, that U.S. schools had been spending
their money in a way that helped keep children out of
jail and helped them learn. Americans might do well to
study Park View Education Centre. It is a high school up
in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia, and something
weird and wonderful had been happening there over the
past few years. At Park View the Internet was not reserved
just for the usual suspects—the would-be Bill Gateses, the
local Steve Jobses, the prodigies who already owned PCs
and Macs and were dialing up Christie Brinkley photos on
electronic bulletin boards. Many of the children on the
Net were the at-risk students, those in danger of leaving
Park View because of academic or disciplinary problems.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>They were in the “general-stream” track. And just as in
the States, the college-bound children looked down on
them. That was unfair. Many of the general students were
bright and simply didn’t want to go to college. Some of the
general boys, not all, wore black leather jackets, tight
jeans, and black boots. And they used razor blades to tattoo
the logos of Ford and Chevy onto their skins. The at-risk
girls were less colorful. But some had disciplinary problems
of their own, along with the same lack of interest in
academics. What’s more, certain teenagers in the area
were doing marijuana and hashish and boozing it up;
teachers at Park View worried constantly that the wilder of
the students would turn up on the police blotters.</p>

<p class='c018'>Fighting against pot smoking and other behavior of
the Jernigan variety, some teachers at Park View systematically
used the Net to bolster the egos of the general students
while also improving their scholastic skills. Yes,
alarms went off in my head when I heard the word “self-esteem.”
Too often, at least in the States, this quality came
at the cost of academics. Saying, “You’re good!” was not
enough. Gold stars—if dishonestly earned—would just
teach the children that the educators were liars.</p>

<p class='c018'>Some teachers at Park View Education Centre, however,
were mixing self-esteem with reading and writing in
a way that true Net nerds would love. And it was happening
in a cash-strapped place a continent removed from
Silicon Valley in both distance and technical expertise.</p>

<p class='c018'>This was not borderline Canada. Park View Education
Centre was a good two days’ drive from the state of Maine.
The school served Lunenburg County, a mostly rural area
settled by German-speaking people whose descendants
still reverted to dialect. Bridgewater (pop. 9,000 or so) was
the nearest town. Named for the modest bridge across the
La Havre River, it was in many respects All Canadian—with
streets with names like “King” and “Queen” and
“Prince.” Businesses such as Gow’s Hardware and Rofihe’s
Men’s Wear had been in the same families for generations.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>The Bridgewater area boasted a Michelin tire plant, too,
and a mall and twin cinemas. And it was growing. But
many inhabitants were displaced farmers, lumberjacks,
and cod fishermen; tensions from work or the lack of it
could show up in some homes, to the disadvantage of the
children. When I was researching this chapter, Canada’s
unemployment rate was 10 percent, while Lunnenburg
County’s was 12-13 percent.</p>

<p class='c018'>In at least one way, Park View Education Centre may
have reflected both the business climate and the Canadian
winters, or perhaps just some of the educational crazes of
yesteryear. Park View was built in the late ’70s with narrow
little windows that more or less cheated the classrooms
of a river view. Those slots were somewhat
emblematic; many children hadn’t been outside Nova
Scotia. Even among the academic-track students, fewer
than 40 percent were making it to college. Park View,
then, was not quite the stereotypical place for educational
high tech.</p>

<p class='c018'>Still, the provincial government, colleges, and the
business community had been quietly working with Park
View and other schools to upgrade the workforce. In this
spirit an education professor at Mount Saint Vincent
University, in Halifax, organized a project called Learning
Connections. Pitching in was the Nova Scotia Technology
Network. One idea was to use computers to hook students
in with employers by way of the Internet to give them a
taste of the workplace. It would happen. But something
would overshadow it—student-to-student communication
over the Net.</p>

<p class='c018'>Jeff Doran, a technophobic English teacher at Park
View, wasn’t sure what to think when he first heard of the
grand plans. His tenth grade class of general students did
not exactly teem with computer nerds. Many of the children
had flunked a grade. “Some of them had reading levels
down around grade three or four. One or two maybe
would have been considered at a grade ten level. I didn’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>have any goal except to try to keep them in school and
keep them in class.” He also had his share of questions
about the project itself. “All we were told was that we
would get some computers, and then we’d get this connection
through the phone lines, and the students would be
able to write to people around the world, and then when
the project was over at the end of the year, we could keep
the hardware. I had no idea what we were then going to do
with it, and I certainly had never used it before.” Doran
didn’t even own a television or answering machine. “I still
had a phonograph. But I didn’t even have a tape player, and
I had been writing on the typewriter all my life.”</p>

<p class='c018'>But Doran had something else going for him, something
even more helpful than technological expertise. And
that was an abundance of good, teacherish skills and empathy
for his students, even the ones with the tattoos. He
himself had rebelled. A Harvard graduate, he had fled the
United States during the Vietnam War to avoid the draft.
Doran’s exact political beliefs weren’t the point here,
though; a dare-devil Green Beret might have shown the
same ability to brook the foibles of the general students.
What mattered was that Doran cared more about results
than about whether the children followed every little rule.
Above all he cultivated rather than feared the students’
ability to think on their own.</p>

<p class='c018'>The Nova Scotia Technology Network provided some
technical help, but would not instantly answer every question.
“So,” Doran recalled, “we did a lot of muddling
through ourselves and a lot of teaching of each other. And
that was one of the best things. Some of the students became
teachers because they learned by experimenting,
and then they showed each other. And invariably they
showed me, and so I learned from them. The first thing I
discovered was that there could be no front of the room. It
had twelve computers in it that circled around the walls.
And there was no way that I could stand at any point and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>demand everybody’s attention. I learned that in about
three minutes of the first period.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Significantly, Jeff Doran’s English class for general
students had a one-to-one ratio between students and
computers, a stark contrast to those in just about all other
public schools in Canada and elsewhere. Students could
use the machines not only for networking but also for
word processing. In fact, they started using the machines
so often that in those early days, Doran was holding
classes in the computer lab regularly rather than in the
scheduled rooms.</p>

<p class='c018'>I asked Doran which students he remembered most
vividly from those first days on the Net, and two came to
his mind: Betty* and Mac*. Betty was the only girl of the
twelve students on the first day of school. “She was, uhm,
kind of an old-fashioned, sweet-faced girl,” Doran said,
“with one of the foulest mouths that I ever encountered.
Yeah. But she had to be to hold her own against these
boys. She was surly and sullen and stubborn with me, and
I don’t think she ever actually came to blows with any of
the boys, but she came pretty darned close.” Betty was
brighter than most in the class. And yet, feisty or not, she
lacked self-confidence. Many would have written her off.
More than a few teachers regarded the general classes as
a dumping ground. “She was pretty unimpressed by what
she could do in the computer room,” Doran said. “She at
first was doing most of her assignments by handwriting.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Meanwhile Mac was hardly off to the most promising
of starts. His head was shaved into a Mohawk. A reform
school alum, he was short and stocky and looked a bit like
a small World Wrestling Federation champ, according to
Doran. Mac’s face bore scars from the fights he got into.
He would regularly pound the bejeezus out of other
teenagers. “I’m not sure why Mac was in school,” Doran
said. “It may have had something to do with the law—either
school or jail. He was not happy to be here. And his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>skills were very, very low. He was about the lowest I had
ever seen in a student.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Okay, so this was the raw material. I didn’t expect
Doran to turn either Betty or Mac into Oxford dons—everything
was relative—but I wondered how far he had
gotten with the computers and the Internet.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Well,” Doran said, “once she finally started on the
computer, she started writing more than she had ever
written before. And I believe that’s how you learn to write,
by writing.” She organized her sentences and paragraphs
better, her vocabulary expanded, and fewer spelling errors
popped up in her work—not just because she could spellcheck
but because she cared more. Her scrawlings in a
loose-leaf notebook hadn’t looked so impressive. But now
she could use a computer printer and see the same, beautiful
results as an honors student doing a ten-page thesis.</p>

<p class='c018'>“The second big difference,” said Doran, “was that she
was writing e-mail to other students. Suddenly she had an
immediate audience. This wasn’t some make-believe
English project where we would pretend to have a pen pal
somewhere and pretend to write to them. This was a real
person who was going to read that message and respond
right away, and that kind of feedback made her, and made
all of the students, suddenly aware of the importance of an
audience. And an audience in writing is something that
they had never experienced before, because the audience
was the teacher and who cares what the teacher thinks?
Except that the teacher gives you the mark, so you just
write what you think the teacher wants you to say.</p>

<p class='c018'>“But now Betty and the others had people who would
write back and forth about their weekends, and their
boyfriends, and their dates, and their sports, and their
hobbies, and their cats, and so on. And I think it opened
up a sensitivity to what was acceptable in print, and how
your words can affect people, and the differences between
people—especially over great distances, because a large
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>number of the students that we were writing to in
Vancouver were Asian. In fact they were fairly recent immigrants
to Canada, so their English wasn’t that great. So
actually Betty’s writing skills were better.” And that, in
turn, helped her think better of herself.</p>

<p class='c018'>Meanwhile Mac, too, was progressing. At the start
Doran gave Mac and others a list of twenty words; they
were then to look up the definitions and use the words in
sentences. The time limit was four weeks. Mac needed
the month. He couldn’t even cheat well; copying others’
work, he blundered because he did not know what he
was cribbing. “The last thing that he could ever see himself
doing,” Doran said, “would be sitting in front of a
computer, you know, at a keyboard. With these beefy fingers
of his, he was gonna tap away? I mean, that was out
of the question.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Doran, however, managed to stretch out Mac’s attention
span to put up with the limits of the machines—to
give them the detailed instructions they needed. In computerdom,
people use the term “boot up” to mean turning
on their machines or loading programs into them. And,
Doran recalled, “There were times I half expected he was
gonna literally boot this thing across the room.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Yes,” Mac snapped back at Doran, “I’ll boot the friggin’
thing up!”</p>

<p class='c018'>“And yet,” Doran recalled, “within that one year he
was writing messages to pals in other schools and to me
as well.”</p>

<p class='c018'>By then Betty wasn’t just sassing back the boys when
they teased her. She was actually teaching them how to
use the equipment. Her marks shot up to the 90s. Not content
just to write a few short paragraphs, she was turning
out well-organized letters several hundred words long in
a professional-looking business format. That was unimpressive
by the standards of academic students, but a true
triumph for Betty; she even zapped off a paper letter to a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>suspense novelist she admired. The writing skills she developed
on the Net had helped make this possible.</p>

<p class='c018'>Simultaneously her opinion of herself rose to the point
where she was one of the chattier participants in a video
that Park View students helped make, and that was later
shown on a Halifax television station. Students shot scenes
to send across Canada to counterparts at a school in
Vancouver, British Columbia. And Betty showed up again
and again on camera. It would have been nice to write that
she went on to college, but she did not. She ended up a waitress.
Partly due to the Net, however, she surely was a better
waitress—more at ease with her customers, and better material
someday for management if that was what she
wanted.</p>

<p class='c018'>And Mac? “One of the last things I got from him,”
Doran said, “was a message about how he felt he had been
changing that year, and how he had been improving. And I
agreed—I thought he had, too. And then just about that
time, he pulled this stupid move and got drunk while he
was on a class trip and got kicked out of the school.” But
the story didn’t end then. “Mac moved to British Columbia
and is gainfully employed. In the boys’ cases, the measure
of success is that they are not in jail. In 1990, probably ten
boys were at risk of failing and dropping out of school. Two
were at risk of ending up behind bars or dead.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Reflecting on past and present students at Park View,
Doran noted the little triumphs which led to the big ones.
The Net helped whet the children’s interest in school—to
the point where, often, just about all the students in his
first period showed up. It was a virtual miracle, given the
sleep hunger of adolescents.</p>

<p class='c018'>Clearly the Net could be a truant officer’s best friend.
“I use computers a lot,” one enthusiastic student e-mailed
me from Bridgewater. “I come in on any free time
that I have, I even give up my lunch hour to play with the
computer, but I would really like to have more class time
in the computer room.” She said that computers “hold so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>much wonder to a person. Like me. Writing on a computer
does help out with reading and writing skills.”
Another student, a tenth grader who lacked a computer at
home, told how much he’d enjoyed corresponding with
an aunt and uncle in Winnipeg. At the time he e-mailed
me, his relatives had just had a son, and his e-mail was
going into their baby book. Textbooks alone would never,
never have encouraged him to look forward to school the
way the Net did.</p>

<p class='c018'>I asked Doran if there were any test scores for the children
to document the Internet’s benefits to the children at
Park View. He said that scores by themselves would mislead
since he had improved as a teacher in other ways.
And yet he believed the Net had helped; since he couldn’t
supervise the class constantly, he had learned to foster curiosity
among the students as they explored the Net on
their own. He and some other teachers in the experiment
understood that they and the children would be learning
from each other, that the old authority models were gone.
The same trend was gradually happening in industry in
Canada and the world at large. So if Doran wasn’t turning
out Ph.D.s, he at least was creating better workers.</p>

<p class='c018'>Other reasons existed for his success. The videotape
reinforced the Net experiences. The Park View students
looked forward to seeing their counterparts. Much more
importantly, Doran let children use the Internet in ways
that meant the most to them. The Net was like the videotape.
Doran had expected his students to shoot pictures of
quaint homes, of beaches, of the usual, touristy sites,
when they were showing off the Bridgewater area. Instead
the students photographed the places where they worked
and shopped. And that told all. The e-mail was the same
way; students would most benefit from the technology if it
was on their own terms. At Park View, some virtual romances
even developed between the students and those
elsewhere. One boy wrote to a Florida school asking to be
put in touch with a cheerleader.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>Yet another explanation for Doran’s success was that
students could spend hour after hour on their computer.
So they had plenty of time for school compositions and for
writing letters to friends in Vancouver and elsewhere.
(That wasn’t true of all the students in latter years.
Although Doran felt they did well, they might have done
still better with more time.)</p>

<p class='c018'>Perhaps most important of all, the machines didn’t put
down the general students the way so many humans did.
“It’s been my experience that the technology benefits the
struggling student much more than it does any other student—in
literacy growth, self-esteem, tech skills,” said
Lorri Neilsen, the education professor at Mount Saint
Vincent University who had started the Learning Connections
project at Park View and elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c018'>The positives aside, the Bridgewater experiment was
not a complete triumph. “It’s very important to know the
spirit of this project was carried by a handful of teachers,”
Neilsen said. In fact, just eight of forty teachers in the
school participated in the project. Skeptics were worried
about it taking time away from the usual curriculum. Yet
another problem was the authority question; some teachers
had to know everything and were nervous about students
learning behind their backs. A third complication
was gender: Many female teachers were uncomfortable
around technology.</p>

<p class='c018'>Answers and solutions existed to all those challenges.
In the case of academic students, I could appreciate the
need to cover a vast range of subjects that colleges demanded.
But with a TeleRead-style arrangement, just
about all the major resources would be online anyway.
Old material over a period of time could be scanned into
the national database—a highly economical way to distribute
it, and even better by archival criteria alone since
unread paper material might well disintegrate anyway
without anyone caring about it.</p>

<p class='c018'>Even with the Net as it existed then, students of all
kinds learned many shortcuts that enabled them to turn out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>better papers. The knowledge on the Net was far, far shallower
on the whole than at, say, the Library of Congress in
the States. But it may well have exceeded what the students
could find in some small-town libraries. If nothing else, by
logging onto the Net, they could learn how to stay up with
the most current knowledge—no small edge in an era
when new products replaced old ones in months rather
than in years, and when academic journals proliferated.</p>

<p class='c018'>What about the authority question? That could diminish
in time if schools of education shifted gears and encouraged
teachers to foster curiosity rather than have
students focus just on textbooks and teacher-certified
facts. Would it happen in the United States without a concerted,
TeleRead-style effort? Maybe. But I doubted this.</p>

<p class='c018'>If nothing else, public schools needed to give their
teachers more time to master the hardware and the
Internet so they would not feel so lost when their students
roamed the Net; the equipment alone wasn’t enough.
“Basic technology training is one of the most neglected aspects
of educational reform,” said Andy Carvin, the Net-oriented
educational expert at the Corporation for Public
Broadcasting. “More often than not, when a school or a
school district implements a major technology overhaul,
teachers are introduced to the Internet and all of its tools
in a day or two of ‘training.’” Carvin told me, and he was
right, that teachers should enjoy regular use of the technology
at home and at school so the knowledge wouldn’t
fade away. Too, they needed to know how to “combine that
knowledge with traditional teaching and curricula....It’s
like learning to use a telephone—you can be taught to
pick up the receiver and press a few numbers, but if you
don’t have anyone else’s number or don’t know how to
give out your own number it’s useless.”</p>

<p class='c018'>I asked Lorri Neilsen about Canada, and she said that
schools of education up there were making good progress
toward correcting deficiencies. They had better. In the
new era of giant databases there should be more emphasis
on finding <em>and</em> evaluating information from many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>sources, and less on parroting textbooks. Teachers should
encourage children to look for malarkey in all media, but
especially on the Net, given all the self-publishing there.
Perhaps with more women growing up with computers,
female teachers in the future wouldn’t suffer so much
from the old bugaboos about networks and smart, curious,
uppity students.</p>

<p class='c018'>That still left another issue—the possibility that students
might send offensive messages over the Net and
perhaps fixate on its wilder areas such as the alt.sex series
of newsgroups.</p>

<p class='c018'>“We did have a couple of cases of students in the school
sending threatening and hateful messages,” Doran said,
“but these were not my students. These were what I would
call hackers, computer nerds.” Later Park View forced students
to sign agreements under which they would lose
their privileges if they abused the Net. This was not a hypothetical
issue to me. As I was researching this chapter, I
found “Fuck you all” in the subject line of a public message
of a list devoted to educational uses of the Internet. A student
at an American school had taken over someone else’s
account. Making students sign agreements wasn’t a total
solution, but it was a good one. If a student misbehaved
and lost Net privileges, then he or she would be at a considerable
disadvantage in competing with peers.</p>

<p class='c018'>Addressing the newsgroup question, Park View filtered
out the groups it deemed objectionable. I suspected
that a smart student could circumvent these precautions,
but if that happened, he might well have been intelligent
enough to cope with the virtual temptations.</p>

<p class='c018'>Off the Net, at any rate, students could just as well find
questionable reading material. I remembered the pictures
of Marilyn Monroe that my classmates passed around in
elementary school back in the 1950s. Did anything
change? Should we really deprive children of the glories
of the Net under the assumption that the kids were all potential
pervs? The best approach was the Park View—one making
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>children sign agreements that they would be responsible
for their own actions, and suspending or ending
their much-cherished Internet privileges if they abused
them.</p>

<p class='c018'>Risks aside, the Internet was a natural place for students
of all kinds. Only a fool would dwell on the hazards
of the net to the exclusion of the possibilities there.</p>

<hr class='c032' />

<p class='c018'>Would that all activities of government be as benign
(well, for the most part) as those of the schools. In the next
chapter we’ll learn about Phil Zimmermann and his
brushes with the darker, almost Big Brotherish side of
government.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c017'>If a programmer named Phil Zimmermann had his
druthers, he would be leading a pretty sedate life on
the whole. He drives a Saturn, lives in a small house in
a middle-class suburb in Colorado with his wife and children,
and dons a suit and does a pretty good yuppie act
when he consults for East Coast companies. In California
he fits in with his blue jeans. Short and paunchy, he is
bearded yet harmless.</p>

<p class='c018'>Some American bureaucrats, however, would lump
Zimmermann in with CIA turncoats and peddlers of illegal
plutonium. In November 1994 customs agents detained
him at a Washington-area airport when he was
reentering the States from Eastern Europe. Twice they
combed through his bags then warned him that in the future
he might be in for more of the same.</p>

<p class='c018'>Why this Kafkaesque treatment? Because many in
the U.S. national security establishment hate Phil
Zimmermann’s guts. He came up with Pretty Good Privacy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>or PGP for short—a snoop-resistant way of transmitting
e-mail over the Internet and other networks.</p>

<p class='c018'>Zimmermann loathes snoops and jackboots. Clearly
he was not in the former communist Europe to subvert
democracies; in fact, he was telling people how encryption<a id='r6.1' /><a href='#f6.1' class='c022'><sup>[6.1]</sup></a>
could help preserve their freedom. “I don’t have to
explain to Eastern Europe,” he said, “why it is important
for their governments not to get too powerful.”<a id='r6.2' /><a href='#f6.2' class='c022'><sup>[6.2]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c018'>This dictator-proofing helped win Phil Zimmermann
a “Pioneer Award” from the Electronic Frontier Foundation,
the civil liberties group, which praised him for
creating “a worldwide standard for e-mail encryption.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Zimmermann, however, as the Net’s many libertarians
are quick to note, may end up in jail for allegedly having
violated an American export law that carries penalties
as high as a decade in prison and a million-dollar fine.
The Feds treat PGP-style software as a weapon just like
Stealth bombers, ballistic missiles, and nuclear warheads.
And some Washington bureaucrats hate the idea of such a
privacy protector in the hands of too many civilians who
are not, well, Washington bureaucrats.</p>

<p class='c018'>Even if the Feds don’t indict and convict Zimmermann,
the U.S. government has already done its share of bullying
here.</p>

<p class='c018'>The U.S. Constitution forbids prosecutors from dragging
Zimmermann into an overlit room and interrogating
him without a lawyer present. Tell that to Washington,
however. Although the law bans the export rather than the
import of powerful encryption software, customs agents at
Dulles Airport, eager for any excuse they could find,
quizzed Zimmermann when he <em>returned</em> from Eastern
Europe. An oft-zealous enemy of privacy, the Clinton
Administration has even promoted the manufacture of encryption
devices that would let Feds listen in on supposedly
confidential phone calls. Washington is also spending
billions of tax dollars to make telephone lines more susceptible
to tapping.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>Zimmermann, meanwhile, has been working on a
phone-style piece of software. Used on the right computer
with a $50 sound card and a $7 microphone, it would let
people speak securely over the Internet or ordinary phone
lines.</p>

<p class='c018'>Bill Clinton’s snoops must love Zimmermann about as
much as they enjoy static during wiretaps. Here’s a man
who they fear could break the connection altogether.
Many in Washington, especially FBI Director Louis Freeh,
would love to see unauthorized encryption banned entirely,
the real issue here. And Republican Senator
Charles Grassley of Iowa has proposed to make it a crime
to distribute scrambling programs by way of international
nets if the Feds lacked the electronic keys to defeat them.
The Grassley measure would even ban some software
now classified as exportable.</p>

<p class='c018'>Like it or not, however, Washington no longer can
control the fate of industrial-strength encryption.</p>

<p class='c018'>Far too many Americans—and Russians, Germans,
Czechs, Iranians, Singaporeans, Malaysians, Japanese,
Chinese, you name it—know about the technology. The
Feds instead should focus on different law enforcement
techniques, and on powerful computers to unravel the bad
guys’ codes. But the Clinton people and their allies won’t
budge. They keep dreaming of the mass use of D.C.-blessed
hardware and software to let law enforcement
people listen in on supposedly confidential phone calls.
Just like the old Soviet KGB, the Feds think that bureaucracy
can prevail over technology, and that government
has a God-given right to force citizens to be snoop-friendly.</p>

<p class='c018'>The saga of Phil Zimmermann is hardly the only indication
that <em>some</em> Big Brotherism is alive and well in the
United States—especially when one considers other outrages,
such as the recent net.censorship jihad or the elitist
copyright proposals that would crimp public debate.</p>

<p class='c018'>In all fairness, the United States is less backwards on
encryption matters than are countries such as France,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>which bans powerful cryptography for private use.<a id='r6.3' /><a href='#f6.3' class='c022'><sup>[6.3]</sup></a> And
certainly Bill Clinton isn’t a dictator. In fact, the trouble
with him, at least at the personal level, is the opposite:
He is too much of a wimp to resist civil liberties threats
from the FBI, the National Security Agency, other bureaucracies,
and the more maniacal of the “law-and-order”
crowd on the Hill.</p>

<p class='c018'>Whatever Clinton’s problem, though, his encryption
policy is making him reviled among many skeptical
young people in Generation Net, not to mention the baby
boomers, who suffered lie after lie from LBJ and Robert
McNamara during the Vietnam War. A lifelong Democrat,
I voted for Clinton. I might not again. His constitutional
lapses, or at least those of his bureaucrats, just might help
pave the way for true Orwellian scenarios in the United
States and elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c018'>So might the shameful war that a powerful Clinton appointee
has waged against public libraries, one of society’s
best defenses against Orwellian Ministries of Truth.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Making Sure Orwell Was Wrong,” then, is an apt sub-title
for this chapter. You’ll remember the basics of the
novel <cite>1984</cite>—bureaucrats tinkered with back issues of the
<cite>London Times</cite> to suit the policies of the moment, brainwashed
the proles of Oceania, and spied on most everyone
with TV cameras. All had to obey the mythical Big
Brother. The most vivid image from <cite>1984</cite> was a boot
smashing again and again into a man’s face. In the era of
mainframe computers bigger than overgrown Cadillacs,
many critics of the Vietnam War invoked Orwell and similar
pessimists. Wouldn’t pasty-faced drones in windowless
rooms use the technology to keep dossiers on us?</p>

<p class='c018'>Then microcomputers popped up. Suddenly good people
could use bits and bytes to fight back against Big
Brother. Amnesty International, for example, could keep
databases documenting murder, torture, and other crimes
by dictators. And then, via the Internet and other networks,
Amnesty could spread the news around and marshal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>world opinion against the thugs. Other human rights
groups and environmental organizations benefited, too,
and soon most everyone agreed about high tech: George
Orwell had been wrong. Progressives with unpopular
ideas celebrated the new tools available to them. And conservatives
didn’t disagree that Big Brother was dead; if microcomputers
could nurture freedom and diversity, why
worry so much about antitrust laws and other regulations?
A New York think-tanker would eventually write a reverse
<cite>1984</cite> in which hackers won over Big Brother.<a id='r6.4' /><a href='#f6.4' class='c022'><sup>[6.4]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c018'>Meanwhile, an open government movement was growing
on the Internet, along with efforts to use networks as an
efficient conduit for services. Far from being Big Brotherish
in all ways, Clinton’s people commendably put a wealth of
official documents on the Net, everything from White House
speeches to reports from the Agriculture Department. The
states, too, acted. Californians could track down a complete
set of laws and proposed laws on the Internet. North Carolinians
could hook into an electronic job bank, indicate
their desired kind of work, click on a map to designate a favored
location, and watch jobs pop up. Oregonians could
get fishing-and hunting-license information online.</p>

<p class='c018'>Bureaucrats in Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia,
New Zealand, Argentina, Finland, Austria, Poland, Japan,
and a host of other countries went on the Net to one extent
or another.</p>

<p class='c018'>Even Singapore, hardly famous for civil liberties and
freedom of information, took a few steps to open up. I was
surprised and pleased to find on a government server a
1993 <cite>Wired</cite> article with the not-so-flattering title of “The
Intelligent Island?” Like many countries, Singapore faced
a dilemma. Would the country’s strict culture suffer if the
masses were allowed access to the Net? Singapore had
flogged an American teenager merely for vandalizing automobiles;
imagine if authorities instead had caught him
in a sex act with a local. The whip was in character; it was
a source of local pride, not shame. And yet if Singapore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>didn’t truly open itself on the Internet, if it couldn’t provide
a hospitable electronic environment to megaconglomerates,
the country would fall behind nations with a
freer flow of information.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Most Singaporeans are little rule followers,” a local
hacker told <cite>Wired</cite>. “They are used to being spoon-fed
what they are supposed to know by the government.” He
predicted that Singapore would turn into a “controlled information
center. The government will try to suppress
hackers.”<a id='r6.5' /><a href='#f6.5' class='c022'><sup>[6.5]</sup></a> And yet the very distribution of the article—for
all to see on a Web server, amid official government documents—told
me that the Orwellian scenario was not a full
certainty. If <em>Singapore</em> could ease up a little, there might
yet be a little hope for the rest of the cosmos.</p>

<p class='c018'>However, the need for some healthy paranoia remains,
even if, yes, Orwell overstated his case. An Internet
Central doesn’t exist for bureaucrats to shut down, of
course; messages can arrive by way of many paths, and
electronic mail if need be can travel over normal voice
lines. But martinets of all ilks can’t resist the urge to censor
or unplug. A government computer in Canada is rumored
to be programmed to reject Anglo-Saxonisms as
passwords, and I don’t doubt it. Would that all outrages
were so funny.</p>

<p class='c018'>Claiming software piracy, cops shut down the electronic
bulletin boards of scores of Italian progressives. “In
some places,” the activist Bernardo Parrella reported,
“sleeping people were abruptly woken up facing machine
guns.” The boards were part of FidoNet, a worldwide BBS
system with electronic mail connections to the Internet.
Significantly the police didn’t undertake similar harassment
against the high-tech admirers of Hitler and
Mussolini. The victims were liberal or left wing. Within a
year, the Italian cops were back at it again, seizing computers,
disks, books, diaries, and other materials from citizens
suspected of anarchistic sympathies. This time the police
made no pretense; the raids were clearly political.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>Politicians and bureaucrats can be just as prickly
about sex as about politics. In Singapore, prudes searched
the hard disk of computer systems to see if the good citizens
were enjoying the alt.sex newsgroups. And back in
the States, Senator J. James Exon of Nebraska concocted a
nutty scheme to ban “indecent” material from the public
areas of the Net. <cite>1984</cite> once more came to mind. Big
Brother loathed sex, as Winston Smith, Orwell’s hero,
knew all too well in carrying on an illicit affair with a female
bureaucrat.</p>

<p class='c018'>Jim Exon also hated sex—at least on the Net. I could
appreciate his worries; did nine-year-olds really need to
gawk at alt.sex.bestiality, or kiddie porn, or the next
Brandy’s Babes? Exon, though, again and again, scrambled
his facts. He relied partly on a breathless article that
the <cite>Washington Post</cite> had run under the headline
“Molesting Children by Computer.” Among other things,
writer Sandy Rovner had advised parents to check their
kids’ computers for files ending in “.BMP”. None other
than the Microsoft Windows software, however, left .BMP
files on hard drives—as a way to display images such as
the corporate logo. Might Microsoft be a new Sodom?</p>

<p class='c018'>“Obviously I had not researched the story enough,”
Rovner admitted to her great credit. “I am new to the
world of cyberspace.... I have a computer coach, but even
he is behind on the Internet. Yes, I violated a cardinal rule
of journalism—I didn’t know enough about what I was
writing about. And I certainly wasn’t thinking censorship.
Mea culpa. I am a staunch supporter of the First Amendment,
as all journalists are or should be.” And yet Exon
cited “Molesting” on the Senate floor to justify his repressive,
cyberspace-oriented change in the existing Communications
Decency Act. “Argghh,” went Rovner.</p>

<p class='c018'>Even more significantly, Exon, as noted earlier, failed
to grasp the difference between the Internet and television.
Children wouldn’t just flick on a computer and see a
Madonna look-alike climaxing with a German shepherd.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>They would have to <em>look</em> for pornography. And the industry
was ready to work on software, such as SurfWatch, to
help parents keep their kids out of pre-designated areas of
the Net.</p>

<p class='c018'>Nothing would be foolproof or teen-proof, of course.
Brilliant technologists had designed the Internet to survive
100-megaton H-bombs. “The Net,” said the hacker
John Gilmore in an oft-repeated quote, “interprets censorship
as damage and routes around it.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Parents’ best response would be at home. Mothers and
fathers shouldn’t expect Uncle Sam to play nanny. As
Steve Case, president of America Online, noted in connection
with his company, parents should never turn their
children loose in a city of millions of people. And I believed
that the same held true of the Internet. Why should
parents count on <em>everything</em> being constantly under control.
Put the Net on a leash short enough to suit Exon, and
the pornography would still persist—encrypted and on
non-Net bulletin boards if nothing else—but legitimate
users would suffer. Some Internet providers might even
shut down to avoid legal liabilities. Moreover, in an era of
global commerce, Washington shouldn’t put America at
such a disadvantage. The losses in trade and jobs eventually
would reach the billions, given the estimated hundreds
of billions of Net-generated business.</p>

<p class='c018'>“The only thing that censorship will do is drive the
best and brightest members of the U.S. Internet community
to countries where they can express themselves without
risk of reprisal—and drain the United States of its
valuable intellectual capital,” <cite>Interactive Publishing Alert</cite>’s
Rosalind Resnick would later write.<a id='r6.6' /><a href='#f6.6' class='c022'><sup>[6.6]</sup></a> “Personally I’d rather
see a few four-letter words flicker across my computer
screen every now and then than risk losing talented writers,
artists and programmers to our economic competitors.”
A mother of two, she counseled parents: “Keep the
computer in a public area of the house, such as the den or
living room, not in your kid’s bedroom. Warn your kids
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>about the dangers of pedophiles and urge them never to
give out their phone number or address to anyone they
meet online.” <em>That</em> was a far better approach than
Washington-mandated net.censorship, one that could
work with the smartest hacker-child. Even the hyper <cite>Post</cite>
article had played up similar solutions. But Jim Exon
couldn’t keep his hands off the Net.</p>

<p class='c018'>In a superb illustration of the dark side of electronic
democracy, Exon held up a blue binder full of net.smut
and, on the C-SPAN television network, argued for censorship
of cyberspace. The vote in the Senate was 84 to
16—how could U.S. senators oppose “decency?” Given all
the sex scandals on the Hill, it was scene worthy of <cite>Elmer
Gantry</cite>, the Sinclair Lewis novel about a moralizing
preacher who nonetheless indulges in sex and booze. The
book, of course, ends with the Rev. Gantry promising, “We
shall yet make these United States a moral nation.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Around the same time the Senate was hoping to
Disneyize the Internet, Bob Dole, the Republican majority
leader, was protecting Bob Packwood by opposing a move
to open the Ethics Committee hearings into the personal
behavior of the oversexed senator from Oregon. As reported
by the <cite>Washington Post</cite>, Packwood allegedly had
grabbed and kissed scads of women—from campaign
workers to female staff members, lobbyists, a hotel clerk,
and a baby-sitter—“sometimes forcing his tongue into
their mouth or fondling them.” Packwood, while not
owing up to every particular, had apologized for being
“terribly offensive to women.” And now he and Bob Dole
had voted for Draconian net.morality? Dole had even
teamed up with several other senators, including Charles
Grassley, the champion of snoop-friendly software, to
offer a cyber-censor bill worse even than Exon’s.</p>

<p class='c018'>The ironies wouldn’t stop. None other than Donna
Rice, whose escapades with ex-Senator Gary Hart had
helped kill off his political career, was now praying and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>crusading against cyber smut—as a spokeswoman for an
antiporn group.</p>

<p class='c018'>Another irony hit me. Tobacco and liquor advertisements,
which promote products far deadlier to children
than any obscenities, were reaching the Net. The Internet
Sleuth, for example, one of my favorite collections of Net
indexes, had advertised Smokin’ Joe’s tobacco products
over a period of at least several weeks. And yet the
Exonians could not stop fixating on words and pictures, as
opposed to a massive, proven threat that had killed millions
of Americans. I didn’t want the government to ban
even cancer-weed ads from cyberspace, lest the regulators
go wild and try to make the Net TV-bland; but if Exon and
allies had to crusade, they might as well be consistent
about it. Perhaps as a true children’s advocate, Exon could
even give back the more than $27,000 that his campaign
had collected between January 1989 and December 1994
from the tobacco and liquor industries. That was just a
fraction of his total take, but a statement just the same.
Maybe the operators of “adult” bulletin board systems—who
used the Net to post samples, the real source of the
problem—could befriend Exon-style pols with a well-funded
political-action committee. “PornoPAC”?</p>

<p class='c018'>I wondered what would happen next if the net.censors
won in the House of Representatives. Earlier, in chapter 4,
I had quoted Peter Lewis of the <cite>New York Times</cite> as alluding
to the “pencil-dicked geeks” who flamed him. Would
Washington let <cite>NetWorld!</cite> go out over an Exonized Internet?
This was the only time I had ever seen such language in
e-mail from Lewis, a gifted professional. Society didn’t prevent
a woodcarver from using a certain kind of wood just
because hoodlums might buy some baseball clubs made
from it and split each other’s skulls open. Why, then, draft
legislation that so despicably intruded on writers’ work?
And what about teachers and students of literature, including
bright, stable teenagers under eighteen? Or readers who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>just loved good, expressive writing? Knowingly or not, the
savages in the Senate could be banning even <cite>Ulysses</cite> from
the public area of the Internet. Never mind the forthcoming
age of electronic books; might Washington someday go on
to suppress the paper editions from stores and libraries?</p>

<p class='c018'>Quite correctly the Electronic Frontier Foundation
warned of the folly of turning the public regions of the
Internet into “the equivalent of the Children’s Room at the
public library,” and forcing Netfolks to seek out “adult”
areas. Get carried away on an Exonized Net, use the
wrong word, and the Feds could fine you up to $100,000
and jail you for up to two years. Even in private e-mail
you’d need to behave yourself: You could not harass anyone
with an “obscene” remark or image, lest he or she report
you. What if an ex-lover took innocent comments and
put them in the wrong context? Tough luck. Sooner or
later the courts would probably clean up after the politicians
and toss out the censorship, but that would hardly
matter to the many who suffered in the meantime.</p>

<p class='c018'>In July 1995 the censorship debate was still at full
blast. Just as Jim Exon had relied on the misleading <cite>Post</cite>
story, so did his side brandish a sensationalistic <cite>Time</cite> magazine
cover. A shocked, wide-eyed child gaped at
“CYBERPORN,” as the headline described it “EXCLUSIVE:
A new study shows how pervasive and wild it really
is. Can we protect our kids—and free speech?” Out of character,
Philip Elmer-DeWitt, one of the most Net-aware of
all the reporters in the mass media, had relied on a flawed
paper out of Carnegie Mellon University. The student perpetrator
of the study, one Martin Rimm, had overgeneralized,
and two professors at Vanderbilt disemboweled him
with a 9,000-word rebuttal on the World Wide Web. If nothing
else, the Rimm study had blurred the distinction between
bulletin board systems and the Internet itself and
also confused Usenet with the Net as a whole.</p>

<p class='c018'>Carnegie Mellon investigated whether Rimm had violated
people’s privacy. Most deliciously of all, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>from a Net perspective, he had written something else—a
self-published novel with such picturesque terms as “rectum
rocket.” Would that Sinclair Lewis and H. L. Mencken
had been around to chronicle the circus.</p>

<p class='c018'>Over on the House side, Speaker Newt Gingrich sensibly
let his libertarian side prevail and opposed Exon. I
wasn’t surprised. How could Gingrich play nanny while
railing in general against regulation and bureaucracy, especially
when he himself had set up shop as a novelist?
My fellow liberals, though, were amazed. It was as if they
were watching the T-Rex in <cite>Jurassic Park</cite> gobble up a velociraptor
that was about to enjoy a human snack.</p>

<p class='c018'>Maybe the Exon-style proposals by now will have suffered
the fate of the smaller dinosaur, but similar lunacy
is bound to break out anew.<a id='r6.7' /><a href='#f6.7' class='c022'><sup>[6.7]</sup></a> Among some on Capitol Hill,
the urge to censor is as powerful as the passion for reserved
parking places.<a id='r6.8' /><a href='#f6.8' class='c022'><sup>[6.8]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c018'>If the censors do win, their narrow-mindedness may
backfire in ways beyond the ones I’ve already described—and
these risks will only grow in the future, as the Net becomes
still more international. Puritanical countries such
as Singapore might arbitrarily jail visiting Americans
who, from the States, had made Internet postings deemed
offensive by the standards of local dictators.<a id='r6.9' /><a href='#f6.9' class='c022'><sup>[6.9]</sup></a> The possibilities
are endless. A U.S. novelist passing through a Mideastern
country could become the next Rushdie if the
local ayatollahs deemed his online work offensive.</p>

<p class='c018'>Clinton’s Feds hardly helped when they went jurisdiction
shopping and prosecuted the owners of a California
BBS for sex-related material that violated community
standards in <cite>Tennessee</cite>. Applied internationally, the local-standards
principle could send an American to a sword-wielding
executioner someday. The Bill of Rights, alas, is
just a U.S. phenomenon.</p>

<div class='textbox'>

<div class='sansserif'>

<p class='c018'>Exon You!</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>When the U.S. Senate passed Jim Exon’s net.censorship
bill, the journalist Brock Meeks wrote a lead for
the ages: “U.S. Capitol, Senate Gallery—It’s all over.
Fuck it.” But what happens if net.censors prevail someday
on the House side, too (if they haven’t already), and
you can’t use the F word? Netfolks have a solution:</p>

<p class='c018'><em>Just substitute the last name of the senior senator
from Nebraska.</em> Enemies and lovers can then say,
“Exon,” to each other.</p>

<p class='c018'>That’s obvious. But the gifted trolls at Bianca’s
Smut Shack, spreading a post from the mythical “Ezra
Pound Is Innocent Committee,” have actually promoted
a whole new lexicon in honor of Exon and allies.
For example:</p>
<p class='c034'>Byrd: (noun) The posterior or hinderparts, specifically
the anus.</p>

<p class='c035'>Coats: (noun) Excrement, or as a verb to excrete.</p>

<p class='c035'>Exon: (verb) To copulate with, the act of copulation.</p>

<p class='c035'>Gorton: (noun) The female genitals, or specifically
the vagina.</p>

<p class='c035'>Gramm: (verb) To orgasm. Also colloquially used as
a noun.</p>

<p class='c035'>Heflin: (noun) The female secondary sexual characteristics.</p>

<p class='c035'>Helms: (noun) The male phallus.</p>

<p class='c035'>Specter: (noun) The clitoris.</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>However, a borderless Internet can also hinder the censorship
crowd. If American bluenoses such as Exon tried to
restrict an electronic <cite>Tropic of Cancer</cite>, for example, a U.S.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>publisher just might set up shop in countries with less infantile
politicians. People in the States could then dial up
the computer overseas.</p>

<p class='c018'>Already the Net has made fools of martinets in the
Canadian government. Ottawa tried to squelch newspaper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>accounts of a murder, claiming that the coverage would
preclude a fair trial. So people in the States sent electronic
care packages to their Canadian friends—articles from
U.S. papers. Canadian officials banned a pulped-wood
issue of <cite>Wired</cite> for attacking their stupidity; that was one of
the biggest debacles of all, given the ease of dialing up
electronic versions of the magazine, one of the planet’s
most plugged-in publications.</p>

<p class='c018'>Consider, too, the ramifications of anonymous servers,
which strip names and other identifiers from messages,
allowing Netfolks to circumvent legal bullying by governments
and others. In 1995, the Church of Scientology in
Los Angeles got Finnish police to raid a server in Helsinki
that was posting anonymous exposés of this rather litigious
organization. The server survived. But the cops
forced Johan Helsingius, operator of the server, to reveal
the name of a Church enemy who originated the messages.
“Now users fear their secrets are at risk,” <cite>Time</cite> said
of people using his computer service. Case closed on
anonymous servers? Hardly.</p>

<p class='c018'>Within weeks after the incident I read a note from a
hacker telling how encrypted messages could wend their
ways through chains of anonymous e-mailers in several
countries, with the names of the senders remaining hidden
unless most or all of the e-mailers broke under pressure.
Yes, abuses are possible, such as the release of trade
secrets, outright libels, forgeries, or the most vile and violent
of pornography. But how much better to live out this
future than one of the Orwellian variety. Tyrant-bashers
in the Thirteen Colonies used the wizardry of their day,
the printing press, to agitate against the Tories; now let’s
hope that if Exonian politicians try to stifle the Net,
enough hackers will have their most dangerous presses
ready to go, the servers I’ve just described. Obsolete or not,
the censors aren’t going to stop.</p>

<p class='c018'>Other Big Brotherish urges have surfaced. While some
Power People hope to be able to learn more about us by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>fighting PGP-style programs, they are stymieing our efforts
to learn more about <em>them</em>. At the same time the Feds
put online thousands of public documents and even the
visage of Bill Clinton’s cat, some politicians on the Hill
sought to <em>weaken</em> the Freedom of Information Act, which
makes it easier to dig up dirt on public officials. Just as
important, Clinton people in early 1995 were proposing
new copyright laws that in effect would discourage the intelligent
discussion of public issues on the Internet. It
would be harder to share electronic newspaper clips.
Even more disturbingly, Clinton’s copyright policy could
menace our public library system in the future. Bruce
Lehman, his czar of intellectual property, was coming
across as Andrew Carnegie in reverse.</p>

<p class='c018'>Carnegie is remembered as a Scot who grew rich off
steel in the States and who encouraged people throughout
the world to start libraries for all. He gave millions toward
library buildings, with the understanding that the local
taxpayers would finance their support. Carnegie wanted
public libraries to be universities for the common man,
and the metaphor holds up. Today, without paying for college
or even for books, <a id='corr222.22'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='American'>Americans</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_222.22'><ins class='correction' title='American'>Americans</ins></a></span> can educate themselves
on subjects ranging from microcomputer chips to medieval
history, to Alexis de Tocqueville’s writings on
democracy, to the case for or against feminism or abortion
or public broadcasting or capital punishment. That is
life in the era of paper books.</p>

<p class='c018'>If Lehman had his wishes, however, Americans would
not be able to dial up copyrighted electronic library books
from home by way of the Internet Instead they would
have to tote around CD-ROMs and floppy disks.</p>

<p class='c018'>William F. Buckley Jr. wrote that, in the era of the
Internet, the Lehman vision would be “the equivalent of
requiring everyone who listens to music to buy 78 rpm
shellac records. What will the children dial in to read?
The collected speeches of Vice President Al Gore? And believe
it or not, there’s also talk of the Postal Service getting
involved in local public libraries through information
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>kiosks.”<a id='r6.10' /><a href='#f6.10' class='c022'><sup>[6.10]</sup></a> In effect the White House approach would jack
up the price of independent, privately originated information,
while making it easier to obtain Washington-blessed
information.</p>

<p class='c018'>The information kiosks led some librarians to think of
noses and camel’s tents. For the Postal Service at one point
said it would let local librarians and citizens use the kiosks
to retrieve only designated categories of information, as
opposed to, say, everything on the World Wide Web. On a 1
to 10 scale of Big Brotherism, the kiosk idea as originally
proposed was an 8.5 or worse.<a id='r6.11' /><a href='#f6.11' class='c022'><sup>[6.11]</sup></a> If the postal bureaucrats
weren’t trying to be Big Brother in the strictest sense—and
no, they weren’t—then they at least were unwittingly
paving the way for him.</p>

<p class='c018'>Worse, the Postal Service has talked of issuing tens of
millions of “U.S. Cards” that would “mediate all government
services and controls over citizens,” while at the
same time an Internal Revenue Service official has proposed
a system that would file our tax returns for us.<a id='r6.12' /><a href='#f6.12' class='c022'><sup>[6.12]</sup></a> I
hate both ideas. Rather than compiling Orwellian dossiers
on citizens, governments should help us computerize via
TeleRead-style programs so we can more easily do the “paperwork”
ourselves by way of electronic forms. Investigators
could audit the forms, but only under appropriate
circumstances. How much better this would be—not just
e-books, but electronic empowerment against bureaucracy—than
the vision that Washington and other governments
have in mind for us.</p>

<p class='c018'>Perhaps the Lehman idea and the Postal and IRS plans
will have been beaten back or rendered harmless by now.
Whatever happens, though, it is clear that new technology
may harm both privacy and democracy if our vigilance
lapses.</p>

<p class='c018'>The threat of electronic oligarchy, stanching the
free flow of facts that intelligent nonmillionaires demand,
is hardly unique to the States. In the United
Kingdom, for example, The <cite>Times Higher Education
Supplement</cite> has warned against a copyright regime that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>would be a paradise for read-o-meter companies but a
nightmare to people valuing free libraries. Just like
Lehman’s proposal in the U.S., the wrong laws in the
U.K. could lead to a Copyright Gestapo; let’s hope that
neither country will criminalize one of the prerequisites
for democracy: curiosity.</p>

<p class='c018'>Given the global nature of both encryption technology
and copyright law, the whole world should be watching
Washington’s policies. The Clinton Administration, after
all, hopes to internationalize the same mindset that could
send Phil Zimmermann to jail; in fact, many of the
American export controls <em>are</em> in effect in other countries,
raising the possibility that an Australian or a British
hacker could end up someday in the same predicament. In
the pages that follow I’ll tell about the battles that
Zimmermann and his allies have fought with Washington.</p>

<p class='c018'>You’ll read, too, of my fight for an alternative to the
Lehmanesque copyright law. My little case history suggests
that the White House is not so eager to listen to ordinary
mortals who speak up on the Net. Clinton’s people
would rather pander to the usual campaign contributors.
So far at least, pious rhetoric notwithstanding, they have
basically neglected the need to put the public library system
online with free or low-cost books from the private
sector. Video just might end up reigning even more
supreme than it does today—at the expense of abstract
thought and democracy. Winston Smith would not be
happy.</p>

<p class='c018'>Father Bill Morton, an Anglican priest in Woodstock,
New Brunswick, could take confessions via e-mail without
violating his vows. Encryption software guarded the privacy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>of his communications. In Florida a bright teenager
without any vices—but with a nosy mother—could protect
her diaries. And in New York, an employee of a leading
investment house could routinely guard his credit
card number. The same software made it possible for
thousands to use the Net for confidential business transactions.
At the same time, democratic activists in the former
Soviet Union would be able protect their messages if
tyranny returns.</p>

<p class='c018'>The name for this encryption package was PGP and by
1995 it was as much a cause as a program. Thousands had
downloaded it off the Internet and other networks. Named
in tribute to Ralph’s Pretty Good Grocery on Garrison
Keillor’s radio show, PGP stood for Pretty Good Privacy.
PGP lived up to its name—people needed it. Part of the reason
was the nature of the Net itself. A skilled hacker could
intercept unencrypted e-mail more easily than on the regular
commercial networks. Mail often passed through computers
at a number of universities and companies before
reaching its destination. Without question the best way to
protect the contents of your outgoing mail was to scramble
its message before you sent it into cyberspace.</p>

<p class='c018'>PGP was also popular because its use showed that the
Net would never accept Clipper chip encryption schemes—designed
to make it easier for the government to snoop on
citizens.</p>

<p class='c018'>Not surprisingly, then, at the time I was writing this
book, Phil Zimmermann was a hero to many on the
Internet. His program meant dignity. It meant safer commerce
on the Net. Other privacy protection programs existed,
but his was most popular, making it all the more
useful. So when the Feds threatened Zimmermann, many
people correctly felt as if Washington were attacking them
along the way. The irony was that the federal government’s
policies against safe encryption could actually
threaten world security and had already set back efforts
on behalf of computer security.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>In a sense the PGP story was part of a continuum, and
not just because the Egyptians had scrambled messages
four thousand years ago or because encryption had been a
staple of Cold Warriors.</p>

<p class='c018'>Even while growing up in Miami and Fort Lauderdale,
Phil Zimmermann had tinkered with secret codes. At
around age ten he had learned Morse code, Braille, and,
via lemon juice, invisible ink. By his teens he was building
code wheels; at Florida Atlantic University, he kept up
his passion for puzzles and secrets. He started out there in
physics; switched to computer science; married; packed
up for Boulder, Colorado, where he became a computer
consultant; and thought of a move to New Zealand. Phil
Zimmermann believed it would be safer, in the event of
nuclear war, than Ground Zero countries.</p>

<p class='c018'>Instead of leaving the States, however, Zimmermann
decided to stay and help throttle back the military. Along
with the astronomer Carl Sagan and Daniel Ellsberg of
Pentagon Papers fame—and hundreds of others—Zimmermann
was arrested at testing grounds in Nevada.
Soon his love of computers would be converging with his
distrust of people in uniforms.</p>

<p class='c018'>Zimmermann in the early ’80s was selling a gadget
that plugged into an Apple II computer but used an 8088
chip just like the then-new IBM personal computer. This
gadget was designed to allow people to keep their old
Apple hardware and software while running new programs
for the fast new chip. Zimmermann called his
company Metamorphic Systems. A programmer from
Arkansas saw a Metamorphic ad and called Zimmermann
to pitch to him an encryption system that was too long to
run on most machines. Would Zimmermann care to adapt
the system to run on an 8088 chip? He would.<a id='r6.13' /><a href='#f6.13' class='c022'><sup>[6.13]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c018'>RSA was the encryption method here. Named after its
three originators—Ronald Rivert, Adi Shamir, and Len
Adleman—RSA was a virtually uncrackable form of public
key encryption. So what did <i>public key</i> mean? Well, you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>didn’t have to worry about the wrong set of eyes seeing the
jumble of letters and other characters that made up keys
for messages transmitted to you. You could freely spread it
around. Then someone who wanted to send something
confidential to you didn’t have to contact you for a secret
key known only to you. He could use your public key by
way of his RSA software.</p>

<p class='c018'>Simply put, the public key approach did away with a
major problem: how to send descrambling tools over networks
if the information itself wasn’t secured. People who
didn’t know each other could trade public keys, then share
secrets from the start. They could even use the same software
to verify their identities with the help of trusted third
parties, who “signed” the keys with sequences of their
own. Imagine the many possibilities for allowing safe business
transactions on networks between strangers. A lucrative
business just might await Zimmermann if he added
his own wrinkles.</p>

<p class='c018'>With RSA, however, came a series of legal nightmares
for Zimmermann. Starting work on his own software
using RSA, he hadn’t any idea at the start that
Rivert, Shamir, and Adleman would be claiming a patent
on it.</p>

<p class='c018'>The trio farmed their rights out to RSA Data Security
and, eventually, Public Key Partners. Jim Bidzos, negotiating
for RSA, in many ways stood out as a political and philosophical
opposite of Zimmermann. Bidzos carried a Greek
passport for business reasons but at the same time felt patriotic
enough to have volunteered for the U.S. Marines. The
way Bidzos tells the story (to Simson Garfinkel, author of
<cite>PGP: Pretty Good Privacy</cite>), Zimmermann asked for a “free
license” for use of RSA. “When I told him ‘No,’” Bidzos
said, “he was really upset. He told me that he was behind
on his mortgage payments and that he had invested years
in writing this piece of software.” Bidzos said he suggested
that Zimmermann try licensing the patent from a larger
company.<a id='r6.14' /><a href='#f6.14' class='c022'><sup>[6.14]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>Zimmermann’s own side of the story differed starkly—in
1991 he wrote Jim Bidzos a letter saying that Bidzos
and Ron Rivert had told him that “you would grant me a
free license to make and sell products with your algorithm.”<a id='r6.15' /><a href='#f6.15' class='c022'><sup>[6.15]</sup></a>
A few years later he would note to the <cite>Wall
Street Journal</cite> that he hadn’t sold PGP before his contract
with ViaCrypt, one of RSA’s licensees.<a id='r6.16' /><a href='#f6.16' class='c022'><sup>[6.16]</sup></a> He steadfastly
maintained he had not broken any laws. Many on the
Internet would have agreed, if for no other reason than
that they considered software patents to be abominations.
Without patents to limit them, many programmers
felt they could be more creative. Their ethos was quite in
line with the traditional Net ethos. The predecessor of
the Internet, after all, hadn’t just been started to allow
the Pentagon to survive nukes. It also existed to share
knowledge.</p>

<p class='c018'>By 1991 the patent issue wasn’t the only one dogging
Zimmermann. The U.S. Senate was considering a law
that would in effect ban Fedproof encryption here in the
United States and potentially prevent him from selling
the software on which he had been toiling for years now.
Washington already forbade export of encryption abroad.
The Cold War was winding down, but export controls
were still draconian. Hadn’t we won World War II because
our technology was better, because we had had
nukes, because we could even snoop on secret code
transmissions from the enemy? The export laws and the
Pentagon put strong encryption equipment in the same
category as munitions.</p>

<p class='c018'>But what about at home? Not surprisingly, the FBI
didn’t want the wrong technology to fall into the hands of
dope rings, Mafiosi, and others planning or coordinating
crimes. In 1991, then, perhaps at the Bureau’s request,
Senator Joseph Biden of Delaware inserted the following
language into an omnibus crime bill: “It is the sense of
Congress that providers of electronic communications
services and manufacturers of electronic communications
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>service equipment shall ensure that communications
systems permit the government to obtain the plain
text contents of voice, data, and other communications
when appropriately authorized by law.”</p>

<p class='c018'>A Senate staffer assured civil libertarians that the
measure would not ban strong encryption. Many disagreed.
Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility,
library groups, academics, and industry managed to get
Washington to drop the offending language.</p>

<p class='c018'>By then PGP was all over the Net. Smart lobbying, not
the software, killed the Biden plan. But Zimmermann’s
work was still a good, sound precaution against a relapse.
Via bulletin boards and the Internet, a free version was circulating
from one end of Planet Earth to the other, having
gone overseas within a day of its release. In Zimmermann’s
words, it spread “like thousands of dandelion seeds
blowing in the wind.” PGP reached Russia and scores of
other countries. It wasn’t like nuclear weapons or mini-computers;
you couldn’t stop a ship from loading or search
the luggage of the suspicious. No, PGP just moved silently
over the wires as hackers throughout the world shared
Zimmermann’s craft. The way Zimmermann told it, however,
he had not broken any of the export laws. And others
supported him.</p>

<p class='c018'>Jim Warren, founder of <cite>InfoWorld</cite> and a software man
respected for his civic activism on the Net, would later recall
that Zimmermann gave PGP to an acquaintance
named Kelly Goen, who “studiously” limited the uploads
to electronic bulletin boards and Internet sites within the
United States. Warren was aware of the uploading process
while it happened. “The whole idea was to provide it to
<cite>Americans</cite>,” he would remember, “so Americans could
have personal privacy and security” in case the U.S.
Senate tried to bottle up decent encryption.<a id='r6.17' /><a href='#f6.17' class='c022'><sup>[6.17]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c018'>The National Security Agency—the secret agency that
dealt with many of the best cryptographers and dominated
the encryption scene in the United States—did not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>complain formally when PGP first hit the Net. And
Zimmermann fretted. Had his baby failed to safeguard
privacy enough to worry the National Security Agency?<a id='r6.18' /><a href='#f6.18' class='c022'><sup>[6.18]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c018'>Back at RSA Data Security, Jim Bidzos wasn’t thrilled
when PGP appeared with RSA technology. He maintained
that PGP violated both patent and export law, and at his
urging, some commercial services and universities banished
PGP from their servers.<a id='r6.19' /><a href='#f6.19' class='c022'><sup>[6.19]</sup></a> Legally, Bidzos may or
may not have been justified. But once again the hacker
ethic prevailed on the Net. Not everyone online took
Zimmermann’s side, but by now he was a serious hero to
a group of encryption boosters known as “Cypherpunks,”
the name that a magazine writer had once given them as
a joke.</p>

<p class='c018'>Many of the Cypherpunks were libertarians, or variants
thereof, and they believed in perfect privacy. The
punks were to encryption laws what the <a id='corr230.17'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Nation'>National</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_230.17'><ins class='correction' title='Nation'>National</ins></a></span> Rifle
Association was to restrictions on firearms.</p>

<p class='c018'>Along with scores of corporations, not just people
whom the White House might dismiss as fringe, the
Cypherpunks wanted to use encryption to protect digital
money. They envisioned a society in which bits and
bytes—representing cash—could pass from person to person
without Party A knowing Party B’s identity. The
Cypherpunks were smart, and often very right. Frustrating
for others, but rewarding for them, they tested the
tolerance of the most ardent Voltaireans.</p>

<p class='c018'>Tim May was among the punk leaders. He had once
worked for Intel, the chip maker. As Steven Levy put it in
an article for <cite>Wired</cite>, May had “‘retired’ at 34 with stock
options sufficient to assure that he would never flip a
burger for Wendy’s.” He in some ways came across as
the Internet’s Abbie Hoffman, say, or Jerry Rubin. Baby
boomers will forever recall these bearded crazies of the
1960s who ran a pig for president and protested materialism
by going to Wall Street and scattering money
around.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>May did not mind getting rich. But he had something
of his own to scatter in cyberspace. It was a series of
taunts that appeared at the bottom of the many messages
he posted to the Net: “Crypto Anarchy: encryption, digital
money, anonymous networks, digital pseudonyms, zero
knowledge, reputations, information markets, black markets,
collapse of governments.” If Washington had rigged
up a machine to scan the Net and measure people by levels
of subversion, May would have blown out all the lights
and needles. And one of his programs of choice, as advertised
amid the other subversion? PGP, what else?</p>

<p class='c018'>Timothy May and other Cypherpunks over the next few
years would tap out thousands of messages, exchanging
technical tips, dreaming up new forms of crypto madness,
rallying support for encryption and for Phil Zimmermann.
This was a whole subculture with a language and an ethics
code of its own. Sometimes the Cypherpunks fought among
themselves. Later a punk in Colorado “spoofed” Timothy
May and, using May’s Internet address, posted malarkey all
over the Net. But true to his anarchistic leanings, May did
not press for the dissident’s expulsion from the punk mailing
list.</p>

<p class='c018'>Back in November 1992 the punks may have breathed
a little easier. George Bush lost the election. No longer
would the president be a Republican, a World War II veteran,
and a former director of the Central Intelligence
Agency. Bill Clinton was a baby boomer. He had spoken
out against Vietnam, he had avoided the draft, he liked
Fleetwood Mac, he played a saxophone, and his vice presidential
candidate had made a name as a loyal supporter
of advanced computer networks. So perhaps the Feds
would back off on Zimmermann. At the very least maybe
the security bureaucracy would face a long delay while
the Clinton people puzzled out what to do.</p>

<p class='c018'>Clinton’s sax and the rest did not count, however; in
encryption matters he might as well have been a ninety-nine-year-old
fan of Lawrence Welk. Within just a few
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>weeks of the inauguration, two men from the U.S. Customs
Department were quizzing Phil Zimmermann.
According to the book <cite>PGP: Pretty Good Privacy</cite>, they said
Jim Bidzos had described PGP as a rip-off of the RSA
approach.</p>

<p class='c018'>Following the Zimmermann interview, Customs
pressed ahead both on the patent front and on export law
issues. Zimmermann, however, denied having swiped
PGP from anyone, and he said patent matters should be
between him and Bidzos, not between him and Customs.
At the time the Feds told him he was not the target of an
investigation.<a id='r6.20' /><a href='#f6.20' class='c022'><sup>[6.20]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c018'>Soon, however, two subpoenas suggested that
Washington was still quite eager to justify any and all of
the Cypherpunk’s paranoia.</p>

<p class='c018'>One subpoena went to Austin Code Works, which
sold public-domain software that contained some of
Zimmermann’s work. Washington struck out. It had been
seeking evidence of overseas sales, and Austin lacked any
in this case. Zimmermann hadn’t even sold Austin his
work directly.<a id='r6.21' /><a href='#f6.21' class='c022'><sup>[6.21]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c018'>Washington was more lucky at ViaCrypt, a company in
Arizona, where the subpoena stuck. Zimmermann had
just given ViaCrypt a PGP license. Now he indeed would be
under investigation. In <cite>PGP: Pretty Good Privacy</cite>, Simson
Garfinkel observed that RSA Data did not win similar honors
even though it had placed encryption-related software
on the Internet. Nor did Internet providers such as Netcom,
which stored PGP on computers that people overseas
could reach.<a id='r6.22' /><a href='#f6.22' class='c022'><sup>[6.22]</sup></a> Bill Clinton’s people were letting foreigners
dial up this export-controlled software again and again.
Needless to say, the bullying of Zimmermann still made
the industry nervous—who was next?</p>

<p class='c018'>As if the Clinton White House hadn’t sinned enough, it
was about to embarrass itself in a high-tech version of the
Bay of Pigs. That’s how critics regarded a nitwit scheme to
control encryption and discourage the public from using
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>good software such as PGP. The Bay of Pigs, a cuckoo plan
for the invasion for Cuba, was a legacy that had come to
John F. Kennedy from the Eisenhower Administration.
The odds would have delighted no one but a masochistic
squad of kamikaze pilots. Castro crushed a small band of
Cuban exiles who showed up on Washington’s behalf at
the Bay of Pigs. Like the debacle on the Cuban beaches,
the Clipper chip was really another Republican leftover.
The national security apparatus hadn’t been able to con
the Bush Administration into implementing Clipper before
the election. But Bill Clinton himself lacked the guts
to resist the NSA.</p>

<p class='c018'>“No Such Agency,” as Washington wags called it, operated
out of Fort Meade, Maryland, near the Chesapeake
Bay, perhaps explaining its fondness for assigning nautical
names to encryption plans. Many billions of tax money
had gone into the NSA over the years. Thousands worked
for it. And they weren’t just interested in the survival of
the United States. They wanted job security. Clipper was
going to be a meal ticket. Just as some wishful planners
had deluded themselves into thinking that a small band of
men could tame Cuba, now the NSA was telling Bill
Clinton’s people that it could use Clipper to control the
world of encryption.</p>

<p class='c018'>All those irksome constitutional details aside, the
NSA’s plan might actually have made sense once. The
people at Fort Meade had done the United States a service
by staying ahead of Soviet encryption in the era of tail fins
and air raid drills. But today such an approach was about
as appropriate as a backyard bomb shelter. As far back as
the 1970s, two men outside NSA’s control had invented
public key encryption, which, as noted before, was a good
way for strangers to exchange secure messages and authenticate
their <a id='corr233.34'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='identifies'>identities</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_233.34'><ins class='correction' title='identifies'>identities</ins></a></span> from the start. Whitfield Diffie
was a mathematician, computer scientist, and encryption
expert. Martin Hellman was an electronic engineer. Both
were grouchy about a computer system whose users had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>to entrust their passwords to the systems managers. So
they came up with public key encryption—the same principle
that was behind the RSA approach used in PGP, and
now available from Boston to Brisbane.</p>

<p class='c018'>Even Bill Clinton couldn’t repeal the past. Just as
the Kennedy Administration had justified Castro’s paranoia,
so the Clinton Administration worked hard to do
the same with that of the Cypherpunks. This time
Washington wouldn’t deploy humans. Instead it wanted
to rely on a little computer chip that Steven Levy described
as “just another tiny square of plastic covering a
silicon thicket.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Tumor-sized” might have been more apropos. Clipper,
in fact, was a tumor of sorts.</p>

<p class='c018'>In a human body a tumor serves itself, not its host.
And that’s what Clipper was supposed to do. The Clinton
Administration wanted to license Clipper to the private
sector, where it would show up in millions of telephones
and dominate the market—displacing future encryption
schemes based on technologies such as PGP. Washington
hoped to make Clipper too cheap to resist and to provide a
federal market for Clipper products. AT&amp;T and the rest
could put Clipper in telephones, and then, supposedly,
dope peddlers couldn’t peddle and terrorists couldn’t terrorize
without the Feds having a chance to intercept their
conversations. The government would also work to make
computers snoop friendly.</p>

<p class='c018'>That was the scenario. Like tumors these government-issue
chips were to spread—not only in the States
but also overseas. Eventually the Feds would also announce
plans to make Clipper available through software,
rather than just through the chip. Whatever the incarnation
of Clipper, though, Washington would play down the
fact that it would corrode the country’s constitutional right
to privacy. America’s Winston Smiths would have to trust
a government that had covered up an unhealthy number
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>of deaths from nuclear fallout, given us Watergate, and illegally
spied on thousands of Americans.</p>

<p class='c018'>An old friend of mine, Margaret “Peggy” Engel, a former
<cite>Washington Post</cite> reporter who ran and still runs a respected
journalism foundation, was among the snoops’
victims. Bureaucrats got the phone company to turn over a
list of Peggy’s calls even though she had not committed a
crime. It seems a freelance writer had managed to dig up
some inside information on the failure of the IRS to collect
several billion dollars in back taxes from corporations that
had profited from currency hedging. This same writer
later applied for a grant from Engel’s organization, the
Alicia Patterson Foundation. Vindictively, the Feds snooped
on Engel, too, simply because the writer had made a call to
Engel’s office for an application for a fellowship.</p>

<p class='c018'>So it went. Because Peggy and I talked from time to
time, the Feds had also tracked her telephone and computer
calls to me. They acted against her under a casually
issued court order signed not by a judge but by an assistant
deputy clerk—one of more than 20,000 such actions
issued in the Washington area in 1992. “It’s like getting
your parking ticket stamped,” she told me. “That’s the
level of scrutiny that these things get. And the number
keeps growing. I think it’s because of the increase in fax
machines. I think agencies are using it on their employees
to find out who talked to the press or Congress.” And now
the Feds wanted to license the manufacture of a chip that
would spill our secrets on demand.</p>

<p class='c018'>Granted, the Feds claimed that in the Clipper’s case, one
bureaucrat could not spy alone. The official line was that
people from both the Treasury Department and the National
Institute for Standards and Technology would have to agree
before an interception could take place. If they did, the electronic
keys would go over the wires to local police or others
needing the tap. All this would require a court order. Some
Clipper boosters might well have argued, “We’re talking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>about strict controls.” But Peggy’s experience still showed
the potential the Feds had for promiscuous Big Brothering,
especially since both the Treasury and the Institute were
within the Executive Branch.</p>

<p class='c018'>Later the front pages would sprout articles about bureaucrats
reading the supposedly confidential tax information
of their neighbors or of movie stars. Yes, the tax
people tightened up their operations to avoid repeats. But
supposedly the IRS had been secure in the first place.</p>

<p class='c018'>The NSA might itself prove capable of some nasty
twists. What if it could call up escrow keys from a database
despite all talk to the contrary? Or suppose it had a database
of its own to unlock all the keys? Would it really want
to go to court for authority to snoop? In <cite>PGP: Pretty Good
Privacy</cite>, Garfinkel wisely noted that Washington would let
Clipper chips be exported. And the NSA was allowed to spy
on nondomestic conversations. So he logically wrote: “If
Clipper-equipped radios were being used by Iraqi fighter
pilots, the NSA would want to listen in. Although the NSA
hasn’t said so publicly, it is doubtful that the agency would
jeopardize national security in order to play along with the
escrow system.” The NSA might even work out secret
deals with the company making the chips, to assure that
the results didn’t frustrate the snoops.</p>

<p class='c018'>Adding to the quite-justified paranoia was the fact that
only the dumbest of criminals would rely on Clipper to
protect privacy. So what was the point of using technology
meant to turn the bad guys into jail bait? Why bother to
create it in the first place?</p>

<p class='c018'>Washington countered that criminals would want
Clipper phones to talk securely to the world at large. And I
suspected that, yes, they indeed would buy some equipment
with Clipper. But for plotting a $10 million dope
shipment or a terrorist attack, the black hats would
quickly learn to use other scrambling systems; in fact,
they could run them on top of Clipper so the Feds <em>still</em> got
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>only gibberish. Even if the Feds banned PGP-style protection,
criminals would spread the right hardware and software
among themselves. Like drugs or sex, this would be
a fine opportunity for entrepreneurial lawbreakers.</p>

<p class='c018'>The underworld might even sell Clipper-crackers that
could make criminals just as good at snooping on America’s
Winston Smiths as the Feds would be. High-tech hoods
could call their new business Credit Card Numbers
Unlimited. Small wonder that Clipper appalled many security
specialists.</p>

<p class='c018'>At the same time, experts for the software industry
raised questions about whether the Clipper chip could
penetrate the market and, if so, to what extent? Any way
you looked at it, the plan was crazy. If Clipper couldn’t
catch criminals (and did <em>everyone</em> in the White House
really swallow this bilge?), then who was left? People like
Peggy Engel, her muckraking grantee, and me. At least
part of the time, we would need Clipperish encryption if
somehow it surprised the experts and did catch on; our
banks might not let us use anything else. How much better
if a PGP-style alternative were the standard instead.</p>

<p class='c018'>Technically, Clipper was just as scary as it was politically
and in law-enforcement terms. Scientists and
mathematicians loved to dissect encryption schemes in
academic papers, and keep checking and rechecking
them over the years for flaws. But Clipper’s designers
withheld the information that outside experts could use to
poke holes in the concept. Unknowns indeed existed. A
well-connected scientist at AT&amp;T would later find a significant
weakness in the network version of Clipper, a way to
cripple the snoop-on-me-please feature.</p>

<p class='c018'>All in all, Clipper actually emerged as a world security
threat. Washington was harming electronic commerce by
promoting a crippled and questionable program for encryption.
The Administration in effect was delaying the
adoption of truly comprehensive security standards for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>the international community, especially business people
outside the States. The standards were on the way, but not
as fast as if Clinton’s people hadn’t wreaked havoc on the
private sector by way of moronic <a id='corr238.4'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='expert'>export</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_238.4'><ins class='correction' title='expert'>export</ins></a></span> controls.</p>

<p class='c018'>“We need strong cryptography for mainstream society
on the Net,” Zimmermann told me. “It’s like making locks.
It’s as if I were in the business of selling very, very strong
locks.” He reminded me of the case of Kevin Mitnick, who
was arrested for breaking into scads of computers and
stealing oceans of valuable information. The FBI chased
him for a couple of years. “Isn’t it ironic that this guy was
able to inflict such damage because our systems are so insecure?”
Zimmermann asked. “Our own government suppressed
the availability of strong encryption technology.
They brought it on themselves, or, I should say more accurately,
they brought it down on us.”</p>

<p class='c018'>At the same time, through Clipper and through efforts
against PGP and other effective software, Washington in
effect was lending moral support to dictatorships. Clipper
used a technique called <em>key escrow</em>. That was a nice way of
saying you had to trust Uncle with your secrets since he
had a copy of your key. But what if Uncle weren’t Uncle
Sam? What if he instead were Uncle Saddam?</p>

<p class='c018'>“You may have the Saddam Husseins of the world, the
North Koreans, being able to hang on to power,”
Zimmermann said, “by using this technology to oppress
their own political opposition.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Clipper could do harm even in countries friendly to
the United States. Washington wanted them to adopt
Clipper-style standards. And at the very least the Clinton
Administration was encouraging these governments to
demand the keys to whatever encryption schemes their
citizens used. That could boomerang mightily against
American companies doing business outside the States.
Phil Zimmermann recounted to me a rumor he’d heard
about a giant entertainment conglomerate that had negotiated
a huge deal in France; its executives found the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>French to be uncannily prescient about the Americans’
tactics. The espionage rumor might or might not be accurate.
But fear of French spying against Yanks was common
enough for many people from U.S. firms to be very
careful about what they said on the telephone, or where
they left their suitcases. The French had prohibited strong
cryptography. And the Clipper plan, while not a ban on
decent encryption, certainly deprived American companies
of the moral foundations they needed to protest the
French law. In the long run a Clipper arrangement might
indeed pave the way for a ban in the United States itself
against PGP-strength products, and already it could prop
up such moves abroad, to the great disadvantage of
American companies with secrets to protect.</p>

<p class='c018'>In another way, too, Clipperish approaches would
make U.S. companies less competitive. American software
firms wanted to build encryption into spreadsheets,
databases, word processors, and other major applications.
If the Feds bullied them into using Clipper, then their
products would be less attractive than those of rivals.
Consider the market for software to store sensitive material
such as medical records; would a European hospital
favor a crippled American program over a German program
with robust encryption?</p>

<p class='c018'>That wasn’t so abstract a question. An engineer from
the giant Siemens conglomerate in Germany told me later
that he was working on medical software, and he expected
his employer to clobber U.S. rivals if their products used a
questionable, Clipperish encryption scheme. What’s more,
crypto mavens were common enough overseas for even
American companies to think about hiring them in the
former Soviet Union to bypass the export controls. If it
happened, it would be the ultimate statement on the absurdity
of both the controls and Clipper.</p>

<p class='c018'>Not surprisingly, a great hue and cry against Clipper
came from the American software industry, and meanwhile
the hackers themselves were waging full-scale
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>warfare against it on the Net. Thousands of Netfolks participated
in the anti-Clipper activities of groups such as
the Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility, the
first group to sound the tocsin.</p>

<p class='c018'>In 1994, however, as clueless as ever, the White House
officially endorsed Clipper—no ifs ands or buts—and
made arrangements for the production of the chips.
“Encryption is a law-and-order issue since it can be used
by criminals to thwart wiretaps and avoid detection and
prosecution,” Al Gore said in justifying Clipper. “It also
has huge strategic value. Encryption technology and cryptoanalysis
turned the tide in the Pacific and elsewhere
during World War II.” But exactly. People on the Net
thought that Clipper was just plain brain-dead as a way to
protect security, a triumph of bureaucrats over techies.</p>

<p class='c018'>You even didn’t have to be on the Net to hate the tumor
chip. At the request of <cite>Time</cite> and CNN, Yankelovich
Partners polled 1,000 Americans; did they think that private
phone calls mattered more than wiretap powers for
police? Four-fifths opposed Clipper. Newspapers churned
out editorial after editorial, and with good cause: Imagine
the joys of trying to expose government corruption if the
biggest crooks on the public payroll might someday be
able to monitor your conversations whenever they wanted.</p>

<p class='c018'>Quite properly, then, most citizens did not trust
Washington. Hackers wore sweatshirts that played on a
slogan that Intel used to promote computers using its
chips. Alluding to Clipper, the sweatshirts read, “Big
Brother Inside.” Tens of thousands of people on the Net
lent their names to an anti-Clipper petition originated by
Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility. John
Perry Barlow, the Grateful Dead lyricist who cofounded
the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told how snoopy Feds
would have to kill him and pry his private PGP key from
his “cold, dead fingers.” Through it all, meg after meg of
messages went out over the Net—everything from sophomoric
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>diatribes to carefully reasoned pleas for anti-Clipper
letters to local members of Congress.</p>

<p class='c018'>After questioning some arguments against Clipper,
one man found himself vilified all over the Net, complete
with a lie that he had made a homosexual advance
against a hacker. The privacy movement was supposed to
defend Americans’ right to dissent, not enforce its own
form of alternative orthodoxy. I felt grumpy, then, about
the smear. But that was a relatively rare incident; typical
opposition to Clipper was passionate but high minded.</p>

<p class='c018'>Except for the smear described above, the meanest
statements came not from Clipper foes but from Stewart
A. Baker, a PGP critic who was about to return to private
practice after serving as chief counsel for the National
Security Agency. <cite>Wired</cite> commendably let Baker give his
side. The magazine did so “with all the enthusiasm,”
Baker wrote, “of Baptist ministers turning their Sunday
pulpits over to the Devil.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Understandably Baker began by denying that Clipper
would “create a brave new world of government intrusion
into the privacy of Americans.” Baker said that key escrow
would merely maintain Washington’s rights to do wire-taps
as presently authorized. That was a wrong; the government
actually was going out of its way to make us all
tap ready, as if we were back in the old Soviet Union in the
KGB era. But at least in this case Baker wasn’t maligning
the Net. The nastiness oozed out later when his article
took on “Myth Number Two: Unreadable encryption is the
key to our future liberty.” Baker shrugged off such reasoning
as “the long-delayed revenge of people who couldn’t
go to Woodstock because they had too much trig homework.
It reflects a wide—and kind of endearing—streak of
romantic high-tech anarchism that crops up throughout
the computer world.” Then he let loose against PGP-style
programs itself. “Some argue that widespread availability
of this encryption will help Latvian freedom fighters today
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>and American freedom fighters tomorrow.” Presumably
thousands of PGP boosters were hunkered down making
bombs in Manhattan basements.</p>

<p class='c018'>Having tried to ignore the legitimate uses of PGP by
thousands of peaceful, law-abiding citizens, Baker then
told how “a high-tech pedophile in Santa Clara, California,
had a PGP-encrypted diary of his contacts with susceptible
young boys using computer bulletin boards all over
the country.” Oh. So between overthrowing the government,
PGP users would be seducing eight-year-olds.
Baker huffed that “if unescrowed encryption becomes
ubiquitous, there will be many more stories like this.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Poor Baker. If he’d really wanted to do his attacks
right, he could have quoted with full grimness the writings
that Timothy May, the Cypherpunk, had posted on
the Net in the spirit of Jerry Rubin and Abbie Hoffman.</p>

<p class='c018'>May was the author of a long, detailed, sometimes
even Talmudic list of frequently asked questions and answers
on cryptography and the fight for privacy, which
might or might not have been on the Net at the time Baker
was writing his <cite>Wired</cite> piece. But if not, he could have
found equivalent thoughts among May’s many postings to
the <a id='corr242.23'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Cyperpunks’'>Cypherpunks’</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_242.23'><ins class='correction' title='Cyperpunks’'>Cypherpunks’</ins></a></span> rather public list. Laying out the case
against strong encryption programs in the PGP vein, May
conjectured that they could make killing for hire much
more practical. People using encryption could rely on
trusted agents who dispensed anonymous digital cash.
“There are some ways to reduce the popularity of this
Murder Incorporated system,” May said, and kindly assured
readers that he had been thinking about them.</p>

<p class='c018'>For good measure May noted that racists such as the
Aryan Nation were using encryption, and “other kinds of
terrorists” might be relying on it as well. “Expect more
uses in the future, as things like PGP continue to spread.”
As if that weren’t enough to pull bureaucrats’ chains, May
said: “Many of us are explicitly anti-democratic and hope
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>to use encryption to undermine the so-called democratic
governments of the world.”</p>

<p class='c018'>May, ever the idea juggler, also weighed in with some
powerful arguments <em>for</em> PGP that appealed strongly to a
stodgy old Democrat (small “d” as well) like me. Even the
Feds should have grasped them. “Could strong crypto be
used for sick and disgusting and dangerous purposes?” May
asked. And then he answered himself: “So can locked doors,
but we don’t insist on an ‘open door policy’ (outside of certain
quaint sorority and rooming houses!). So do many
forms of privacy allow plotters, molesters, racists, etc., to
meet and plot.” Whatever May was, anarchist, libertarian,
objectivist, or nothing, he was making more sense in those
three sentences than Baker could have in a 1,000 essays.</p>

<p class='c018'>After May signed up for Cyberia, a legally oriented list,
he was one of the favorite nonlawyers there, winning
friends even among those who disagreed with his politics.
In one limited way he may have been more threatening to
Washington than Hoffman or Rubin, for, rather than just
ranting and raving and putting on a good show, he could
communicate all too cogently with members of the establishment.
At the same time the Feds were fixating on
Zimmermann, May casually told the lawyers how he
moved in and out of the country without letting Washington
veto his speeches on encryption. In effect his gleeful confession
made mockery of the laws. If D.C. couldn’t even control
a traveler—there in flesh and blood—how could it
monitor electrons speeding over the phone wires?</p>

<p class='c018'>“I myself just presented a paper on ‘Crypto Anarchy
and Virtual Communities’ in Monte Carlo,” May told the cyberlawyers,
at least one of whom was an attorney from the
Justice Department. “I described algorithms, methods, etc.,
and was never asked or instructed to submit to the Men in
Black in D.C.” He was even carrying around “several gigabytes
of code, essays, programs.” But never was he “ever
stopped, questioned, or searched. Only upon landing in San
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>Francisco was I asked to state my business overseas. I said I
was meeting with cryptographers from around the world!
This was met with confusion by the twenty-two-year-old
Customs officer; but after asking if any of them were from
Russia or Iraq, and I told him I had no idea if there were or
not, he waved me through.” May said most U.S. cryptographers
“just shrug and ignore the <em>possibility</em> that our papers
may be illegal to present outside the U.S.”</p>

<p class='c018'>His observations came as the Electronic Frontier
Foundation was trying to resolve matters in a more tidy
way. It was sponsoring a lawsuit to prevent Washington
from restricting the spread of encryption-related writing
and software. Quite correctly the EFF argued that the encryption
laws were an “impermissible prior restraint on
speech, in violation of the First Amendment.” An EFF victory,
needless to say, could nuke the government’s case
against Zimmermann.</p>

<p class='c018'>With Hooverian tenacity, as if Phil Zimmermann were
Dillinger or a godfather, Washington kept up its harassment
and even escalated it in some ways. Jim Warren saw
this happen firsthand. He had asked to testify several years
ago in Zimmermann’s defense, but the authorities ignored
his request. Then in 1995 he had published op-ed pieces in
San Jose and San Francisco papers, in which he throttled
the FBI and NSA for getting in the way of the best possible
security on the Net. In the wake of the Mitnick break-ins,
he had accused the Feds of “endangering millions of innocent
citizens and <a id='corr244.28'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='law-aiding'>law-abiding</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_244.28'><ins class='correction' title='law-aiding'>law-abiding</ins></a></span> businesses that use the Net or
cell phones, in order to protect their ability to monitor the
few who might be guilty of something.” Almost immediately
two U.S. Customs agents favored Warren with a surprise
visit to his house and quizzed him about
Zimmermann and PGP. “When they began the interview,”
he said, “they handed me a subpoena that said I was
‘COMMANDED to appear and testify before the Grand
Jury of the United States District Court’ in San Jose.“<a id='r6.23' /><a href='#f6.23' class='c022'><sup>[6.23]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>“Who says government isn’t responsive,” Warren
quipped.</p>

<p class='c018'>He said this in a folksy newsletter sent to hundreds of
people on the Net. Its well-earned name was <cite>Government
Access</cite>; he had been the main organizer of a successful
campaign to get California to put legislative information on
the Internet for free. As much as anyone he was trying to
work within The System. Yet he was ever skeptical toward
“Congress Critters.” Again and again Warren’s newsletter
in effect depicted a Washington that could be Torylike in its
contempt toward Netfolk.</p>

<p class='c018'>Warren didn’t just write of the well-publicized threats
like the Exon bill, or the Clinton Administration’s prosecution
of a couple in California because their sex-oriented
BBS did not come up to Bible Belt community standards
in Tennessee, or the Zimmermann case itself. Warren also
wrote of obscure people such as a Berkeley-area hacker
who, enraged by restrictions on encryption and by other
actions in the vein of King George’s Stamp Act, had fled to
Sweden.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Sweden is no paradise,” the expatriate told Warren
via e-mail, “but I don’t ever worry that the government is
going to break into my home. I know that I’ll be able to
run my BBS, maintain all the contacts I’ve developed over
the years, and continue to use the various nets without
fear of Uncle Sam attacking me. So now I’m trading in my
U.S. passport for one that is a lot less threatening to me
and my PC.” Warren added: “This is the second former
American I have known who has done this for exactly
these reasons!” I remembered a hacker libertarian who
had been hoping to construct an island in the Caribbean,
beyond the reach of technophobic politicians.</p>

<p class='c018'>Warren was disappointed enough with Washington to
tell the Net: “I’m beginning to feel like a German Jew in
1935.” He didn’t just hate Clipper and the harassment of
Zimmermann. On top of everything else, Washington had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>recently passed a digital telephone bill that “would make
Lyndon Johnson, Nixon’s Watergate team, and J. Edgar
Hoover drool on their bibs.” The project would cost the
taxpayers billions of dollars over the years—all this to
make the phone system more tappable, out of fear that
crooks might otherwise forward phone calls to bugfree locations.
Washington was actually setting aside more
money for snooping than for electronic libraries. And now
Warren feared that the Feds someday would ban encryption
outright.</p>

<p class='c018'>Beyond D.C.’s computer-related stupidities, he loathed
the way the Feds played fast and easy with the Constitution
on matters such as drug law enforcement. Agencies, for
example, could keep money and equipment taken from
suspects and use them for their own purposes, thus giving
police “a profit motive” to abuse Americans’ rights.</p>

<p class='c018'>“No doubt,” Warren said, “many in Germany told that
nation’s Jews, ‘It’s not that serious’ and ‘It’s just a phase—it’ll
pass’ as they disarmed the citizens in the name of law
and order only a few years before filling the camps and
ovens that somehow good, law-abiding Germans just
never knew about until after the war. If we don’t watch
out, our government’s cure for ‘crime’ will become even
more dangerous than the illness. And this time, I don’t
think Sweden will be a safe haven.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Clearly Warren was a long, long way from the optimism
of <cite>Orwell’s Revenge</cite>, the book in which Big Brother
lost to the hackers.</p>

<p class='c018'>I doubted that the United States was quite as Oceania-like
as Jim Warren obviously believed, and his own
German parallel might be stretching it. Stamp Act parallels
did, however, fit. An old, ignorant, Torylike order
wanted to pass laws to contain the new, and I could envision
an increasing number of ugly confrontations between
bureaucrats and Netfolk. Baker, the ex-NSA man,
hadn’t hesitated in the least to come up with his wacky
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>characterizations of Clipper foes. To the D.C. policy elite,
we on the Net were fair pickings.</p>

<p class='c018'>All the hype about the Information Superhighway
notwithstanding, most of the Feds didn’t feel quite as at
home on computer networks as billed. Most Congress
members in mid-1995 still lacked public e-mail addresses.</p>

<p class='c018'>Meanwhile, the Net was catching on among millions
of younger <a id='corr247.8'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='American'>Americans</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_247.8'><ins class='correction' title='American'>Americans</ins></a></span> who surfed freely, while their
elders could barely master commercial networks such as
CompuServe. By way of Clipper and blatantly anti-network
copyright proposals, the White House was kissing off all
too many within Generation Net.<a id='r6.24' /><a href='#f6.24' class='c022'><sup>[6.24]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c018'>A further embarrassment was the contrasting enlightenment
of some Republican conservatives, who many
Democrats on the Net might have dismissed entirely in
the past. Rush Limbaugh, the right-wing talk show host,
didn’t just show up on CompuServe as a visitor. He personally
logged on again and again and even met his wife
there. He might not be on the Net itself, but he was much
more at ease with the technology than were the majority
of the liberals on the Hill. Meanwhile, the most powerful
conservative of all, House Speaker Newt Gingrich, spoke
out against the Exon amendment. William Buckley, the
noted conservative journalist, was a major backer of my
proposal for a decentralized national library system online.
And the conservative writer George Gilder, while all
too zealous at times about free markets, had made some
of the most prescient predictions on the direction in
which the technology was headed.</p>

<p class='c018'>Too many Democrats were TV-centric, while Gilder
believed that computers would be the new entertainment
medium, prevailing over television. Sales figures proved
him right. More Americans bought desktops computers in
1994 than purchased color televisions, and it was only a
matter of time until they logged onto computer networks
and worried about their privacy there. And here were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>Clinton and Gore pushing Clipper with more ardor than
they could summon up for well-stocked electronic libraries
for all.</p>

<p class='c018'>Of course, not everybody on the Democratic side was
hopeless, and many Republican law-and-order types
loved Clipper, the Bush leftover. Also, these same politicians
might well applaud the Clinton Administration’s
anti-Net copyright proposals, not understanding all the
undertows that could ultimately drag property rights
under. But at least they hadn’t enlisted civil libertarians
and populists in their campaigns to the extent that
Bill Clinton had. I’d never have voted for the man if I’d
known in advance about Clipper, the harassment of
Zimmermann, and the antediluvian copyright policies.
Bush in some ways might have been preferable. Not
knowing the difference between a potato chip and a silicon
chip, he would have done much less damage. A
smarter, more principled Democrat than Clinton could
pick up the pieces in ’96.</p>

<p class='c018'>Clinton’s Justice Department showed a brazen and
bizarre lack of fairness toward Zimmermann. Until the
statute of limitations expired—and that was fuzzy, even to
lawyers—the Feds might just let him dangle. Without finding
Zimmermann guilty of anything, or even charging
him, Washington in a sense was already leveling penalties.
He had to spend hours and hours away from his regular
consulting business to work on his case.</p>

<p class='c018'>Total costs might reach $300,000 if the prosecutors
decided to act. Even if lawyers donated their time—and
Zimmermann might enjoy the services of some noted attorneys
outraged by the threat to civil liberties—there
would be the burden of telephone costs, travel, and hotels.
Appeals for donations went up in such areas of the
Usenet as talk.crypto.politics, comp.org.eff.talk, and, of
course, alt.security.pgp. People could pay by credit card,
encoding their numbers via PGP.<a id='r6.25' /><a href='#f6.25' class='c022'><sup>[6.25]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>In the end, no matter what happened to Zimmermann,
the real victory might be in the marketplace. And there
Clipper was losing. AT&amp;T and a chip maker named VLSI
Technology came out with a chip that would challenge
even the NSA’s supercomputer. Given a choice between
that and Clipper, who’d want the latter? Even before then,
in fact, few customers were going for Clipper-based
equipment.<a id='r6.26' /><a href='#f6.26' class='c022'><sup>[6.26]</sup></a> In the end it looked as if Washington would
resort not to a chip but to continued pressure on U.S. corporations
to make available the key schemes of more
secure plans. And even then, I hoped, the industry would
balk. The more such foolishness became a habit here, the
less protected would be American companies abroad,
as people outside the States followed Washington’s
example.</p>

<p class='c018'>Some of the biggest Clipper haters, meanwhile, were
overlooking their differences to unite against the tumor
chip. Jim Bidzos’ company had already granted a license
for the basic technology to ViaCrypt, which, at least in the
latter’s opinion, left it free to sell a commercial version of
PGP. And this past action may have been a door opener in
a way for Phil Zimmermann. PGP was no longer so much
of an outlaw program in the eyes of many, and businesses
felt they could use it and get technical support. Beyond
that, professors at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, whence much of the RSA technology had
come, were sick of all the patent wars. They just wanted to
see solid encryption in use. And Bidzos, however much he
quarreled with Zimmermann, was himself determined
that the Feds not control encryption. The compromise
could go a long way toward enshrining RSA as at least an
informal world standard, and thwarting RSA’s biggest
competitor, the NSA.</p>

<p class='c018'>And so Bizdos and colleagues let PGP be used for
noncommercial purposes as long as the newer versions
were incompatible with the older ones that lacked the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>blessing of RSA and Public Key Partners. Of course that
still didn’t solve the hassles of securing international
commerce with a truly strong encryption standard with
which the U.S. government felt comfortable. But even if
PGP-style products weren’t official, they were murdering
Clipperish schemes before snoop-ready chips and programs
could take root. The world’s governments might
well have to join countries like France and try to ban
strong encryption.</p>

<p class='c018'>But could they? Too many people in too many countries
were already using software such as PGP. Hackers
proudly included their public PGP keys—those weird
combinations of letters and numbers—at the ends of their
messages or told how people could obtain them. PGP keys
were becoming status symbols. PGP wasn’t yet built into
popular e-mail programs such as Eudora for easy use, so,
if nothing else, the keys indicated a certain level of technical
expertise. They were the new vanity plates of the dataways.
PGP was even becoming a small industry; for
example, you could shell out $20 and officially register
your key with a company in Palo Alto, California, called
SLED. And then people receiving messages from you
would know they were really from you.</p>

<p class='c018'>SLED required a mailed or faxed driver’s license or
passport, or a preprinted personal check. This wasn’t the
best proof of identity, but it would at least let Netfolks spot
obvious forgeries immediately. If nothing else, you could
“register” your key with friends who were well known
and well trusted on the net.</p>

<p class='c018'>With or without formal registration, more and more
Netfolks felt lost without their PGP. Father Bill Morton, the
Anglican priest mentioned earlier, the one who used PGP
to accept confessions over the Net, wrote a parody:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c036'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>It’s one for the money,</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>Two for the show,</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em><span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>Three to get ready,</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>Now go, cat, go!</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>But don’t you step on my PGP.</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>You can do anything, but lay off my PGP</em>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c024'>Responding to a query I’d posted in several encryption-related
newsgroups, he explained in an e-mail why
PGP meant so much to him. Confessions were just part of
the story:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c018'><i>In the history of Anglican pastoral <a id='corr251.9'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='case'>care</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_251.9'><ins class='correction' title='case'>care</ins></a></span>, there is a
strong tradition of the use of the letter as a means
of spiritual guidance. Actually this tradition goes
deep into the roots of the Catholic Church. Some of
the books regarded as “spiritual classics” are compilations
of correspondence between a person and
their spiritual director. Until the advent of PGP,
e-mail was not a suitable place for such correspondence.
It’s one thing to have your correspondence
published 100 years after the fact; it’s quite another
to run the risk of having your personal thoughts
posted to a Usenet newsgroup or read by the sysop
of a BBS. Now they know that even if they hit the
wrong button and send their e-mail to the wrong
place, it is secure.... Legislation that would make
encryption illegal or require a mandatory backdoor
would totally compromise any trust in e-mail or
any other form of electronic text system such as
word processors.</i></p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>Father Morton’s respect for privacy came through
when I asked for examples of confidences that people
had shared with him by way of PGP: “No matter how I
disguise the facts,” he told me, “even if I were to create a
fictitious person, someone somewhere would believe that
they were reading the details of their life story.” And so he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>was vague, other than to say, to give an idea of the gravity
of what he heard, “Thoughts, dreams, hopes, as well as
lust, anger, and hatred. Sometimes, actually oftentimes,
there are things that you wouldn’t even tell your spouse.
Our lives are based on trust.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Thanks to PGP, Father Morton could maintain that
trust not only with people locally in Woodstock, New
Brunswick, but with Netfolk from thousands of miles
away.</p>

<p class='c018'>Some people met him in newsgroups. “We’ll have an
exchange of e-mail on a specific topic,” he said, “and at
one point it will become evident that I am a priest.” He
neither hid nor played up his occupation. Upon learning
it, he said, the Netter at the other end “may wish to change
the topic and enter into a brief correspondence about a
particular question. That conversation might last one or
two posts and is usually, though not always, in PGP.” In
addition, he corresponded with a very small group of people
regularly about significant events in their lives. These
conversations were always in PGP.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Before PGP,” Father Morton said, “e-mail was
guarded in its content. A typical e-mail exchange might be
to set up a phone conversation or meeting or discuss issues
in very general terms. Now, at least in a few cases,
the PGP mail is much more open in its content, and as a
result the e-mail pastoral relationship can be much more
productive.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Father Morton was not alone in his use of PGP to protect
personal secrets. For example, the Samaritans, a
group devoted to talking people out of suicide, said it
would accept PGP-encrypted messages.</p>

<p class='c018'>“The Samaritans,” announced a Usenet post, “have always
taken the confidentiality of callers extremely seriously.
Indeed the most frequently asked question within
the movement about our e-mail service is, ‘What about
confidentiality?’” Surely, in an era when more and more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>communications happened to be electronic, it would be
folly to deny reliable encryption to the Samaritans and the
people they helped. Although the Samaritans felt more
confidence about the security of unprotected e-mail than
did Father Morton, they understood an important truth:
<em>perceptions</em> mattered as much as anything. If their correspondents
lacked faith in the confidentiality of e-mail,
they couldn’t write as freely. And, as I saw it, they might
not be as open to rescue. If Washington banned PGP, if it
replaced it with an inferior, Clipperish arrangement, the
Samaritans just might not be as successful as with truly
secure encryption.</p>

<p class='c018'>Privacy wasn’t just for confessions and for suicide prevention.
It was also for teenagers. Donna—she supplied
her real name but I’ll protect her with a pseudonym—lived
in Florida and was a seventeen-year-old junior in high
school who was already using PGP. She e-mailed me:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c018'><em>I couldn’t speak for other teenagers and their parents,
but with my extremely intrusive mother, I use all the
privacy devices I can get. I’ve kept extensive journals
since second grade—she’s always read them and
nosed around, no matter where I’ve tried to hide
them. She’s opened letters from friends and pokes her
nose into anything that she considers unorthodox; we
don’t quite see eye to eye on many issues. I’m a good
student, responsible, don’t drink or do drugs, blah
blah blah, but she has continuously invaded my privacy
over the years despite her lack of justification.</em></p>

<p class='c018'><em>Two years ago I tried a locked drawer where I
kept all of my papers, letters, and the like, but she
has opened the drawer with my keys. So now I just
do everything on the computer and encrypt/password
it. I can see how some parents might justify
searching their kids’ rooms—just as police can
under circumstances justify searching homes.</em></p>

</div>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>But, Donna went on, if a child were doing something
<em>illegal</em>, there “would be physical evidence.” That seemed
clear: You could encrypt a diary full of unorthodox musings;
you could not encode a marijuana stash.</p>

<p class='c018'>I would have trusted Donna, but I still had mixed feelings
about most teenagers using PGP without their parents’
sharing the keys. How long until Senator Exon
ranted that the young would encrypt dirty bytes? In the
end, however, just as with children’s use of the Net itself,
PGP should be a family decision, not a federal one;
Washington mustn’t turn into a giant version of Donna’s
mother. Risks from a ban, even one limited to children, so
outweighed the benefits. If Donna’s mother wanted to understand
her daughter, then maybe she needed to spend
less time doing a domestic-level KGB act and more time at
a computer—seeing for herself what her daughter was up
to. In the process she might understand Donna well
enough to tolerate her opinions. She’d better learn to
brook them; her daughter was almost eighteen, the age of
adulthood in the United States. Soon many parents would
be more comfortable with the technology, and then, family
by family, parents could decide whether to be Big
Mama or Big Daddy and look for PGP-encrypted files. It
should be a family, not a government, matter.</p>

<p class='c018'>If nothing else, parents themselves could use PGP to
guard their own privacy. “I use PGP at home solely for
keeping confidential information from prying eyes—for instance,
from my son and my son’s friends, as well as for
keeping their information in one central place,” said Joe
Collins, an employee of an international investment bank
based in New York. It guarded his burglar alarm codes, the
codes to the family safe, all credit card numbers, and all
passwords to software on the family computer. Yes, some
popular software came with encryption, and certain people
might have argued that home users such as Collins
didn’t need PGP. But the encryption found in popular software
was nowhere near in PGP’s league. In fact, Crak
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>Software, a company in Phoenix, Arizona, even sold “password-recovery
software” to crack popular programs such
as WordPerfect, Word, Excel, Lotus 1-2-3, and Quattro Pro
(for backup purposes).</p>

<p class='c018'>AIDS activists especially understood the possibilities
of good, strong encryption; victims of the disease, after all,
were treated about as fairly as lepers had been in biblical
times. In New York a group called ACT UP tried to get the
public health officials to encourage labs to use PGP to protect
the identities of patients. The officials liked the idea.
The program died at the hands of a parsimonious governor;
but sooner or later, I suspected, PGP would be used
in one way or another to protect the privacy of AIDS patients,
if it wasn’t already.</p>

<p class='c018'>In the business area, the advantages of keeping PGP
legal—and avoiding Clipperish solutions—were just as
clear as at the personal level. “PGP is essential,” said
Robert David Steele, a former CIA agent whose passion
for legalized encryption and dislike of Clipper must have
endeared him to many hackers.<a id='r6.27' /><a href='#f6.27' class='c022'><sup>[6.27]</sup></a> “Security is the foundation
for openness. In order for a world of open electronic
exchanges actually to succeed, electronic persons have to
know three things, all of which PGP supports: (a) that the
person on the other end of the link is who he says he is,
(b) that the information being received is genuine and not
altered, and (c) that a digital cash payment will be forthcoming,
assuming that this is part of the transaction.”
Steele was not just talking about the benefits of PGP for
business alone, but clearly it was among the major uses
that he quite properly had on his mind here.</p>

<p class='c018'>Many business people on the Net agreed. I was hardly
surprised to read in the <cite>New York Times</cite> about the use of
PGP “in what was apparently the first retail transactions
on the Internet using a readily available version of powerful
data encryption software designed to guarantee
privacy.” A Philadelphia man had used PGP to scramble
his credit card number and spent $12.48 and shipping
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>costs on a compact disk with rock music from a New
Hampshire company called Net Market. More benefits
were to come. Already other companies were working on
digital cash, which could let bits and bytes go out over the
Net in ways that prevented them from being easily traced.
They would be, in other words, just like dollar bills.<a id='r6.28' /><a href='#f6.28' class='c022'><sup>[6.28]</sup></a> You
could spend them without Big Brother knowing that you’d
bought a <cite>Playboy</cite>, a Rush Limbaugh book, a condom, or
whatever else might somehow cause your neighbors or
your boss to take offense.</p>

<p class='c018'>PGP also made sense for privacy protection <em>within</em>
companies. An accounting firm in Palo Alto, California,
for example, used PGP to guard backup tapes in case of
loss or theft, and a Washington accountant relied on it for
client communications.<a id='r6.29' /><a href='#f6.29' class='c022'><sup>[6.29]</sup></a> And when Zimmermann himself
asked online for PGP testimonials, a man with a
telecommunications firm on the West Coast told him how
much he loved it as an alternative to Clipper:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c018'><em>Once it becomes a standard, the competitive software
industry will have no incentive to continue
technical development in crypto. And then once
Clipper gets cracked by outsiders or otherwise compromised,
there will still be a lot of bureaucratic inertia
protecting it and keeping the fact that it’s been
compromised a secret.</em></p>

<p class='c018'><em>We see a serious need for crypto to protect client
records regarding their telephone systems and computer
networks, to protect our internal company
memos sent via e-mail, and to protect strategic business
information sent via e-mail. We figure that a
misrouted piece of client data is a potentially serious
liability issue, and a misrouted sales proposal or
similar business document is like leaving a credit
card on a park bench. Due diligence, fiscal responsibility,
and all that. The big plus is simply that we
will be able to confidently move a lot more of our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>business online, which will make a huge difference
to us. More efficient handling of client requests,
more efficient internal discussions, and more effective
communication with investors. In particular I
do a lot of strategic business planning online, and it
always bugs me in the back of my mind—‘What
happens if this gets lost on the Internet?’ In one sense
good crypto is like a good business dinner. It <a id='corr257.8'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='facilities'>facilitates</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_257.8'><ins class='correction' title='facilities'>facilitates</ins></a></span>
the flow of ideas in a relaxed atmosphere.</em></p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>At the same time, needless to say, PGP could improve
the flow of <em>political</em> ideas. In 1993 Boris Yeltsin had been at
odds with foes nostalgic for the old Soviet state. “If a dictatorship
takes over Russia,” a message from Latvia had told
Zimmermann, “your PGP is widespread from the Baltic to
the Far East now and will help democratic people if necessary.
Thanks.”<a id='r6.30' /><a href='#f6.30' class='c022'><sup>[6.30]</sup></a> In Burma rebels used PGP against an oppressive
regime. A writer in Thailand said that before PGP
reached them, captured papers had “resulted directly in arrest,
including whole families, and their torture and death.”
Activists in El Salvador and Guatemala also relied on the
program. “In this business, lots of people have been killed,”
said Daniel Salcedo, a member of the Human Rights Project
of the American Association for the Advancement of
Science.<a id='r6.31' /><a href='#f6.31' class='c022'><sup>[6.31]</sup></a> David Banisar of the Electronic Privacy
Information Center told me of PGP being used in Kenya,
Mali, Senegal, Egypt, and <a id='corr257.27'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='’Somalia?’'>Mali</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_257.27'><ins class='correction' title='’Somalia?’'>Mali</ins></a></span>, among other countries.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Wire tapping is conducted in nearly every country in
the world,” Banisar wrote in a paper with the marvelous
title of “Bug Off!” “It is frequently abused.” A 1992 State
Department report, for example, told of governments and
private organizations snooping away in dozens of countries.
And it hadn’t happened just in the Third World.
“There have been numerous cases in the United Kingdom
which revealed that the British intelligence services
monitor social activists, labor unions, and civil liberties
groups,” Banisar said in a paper written for Privacy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>International.<a id='r6.32' /><a href='#f6.32' class='c022'><sup>[6.32]</sup></a> What’s more, the Canadian Communications
Security Establishment had shelled out more
than $1.1 million to scan through millions of messages
and pick out dangerous words and phrases.<a id='r6.33' /><a href='#f6.33' class='c022'><sup>[6.33]</sup></a> Would the
CCSE abuse the system and routinely compile dossiers on
law-respecting people? And what about the FBI here in
the States? Many Netfolks took it for granted that Louis
Freeh’s people were keeping up with Usenet.</p>

<p class='c018'>“The FBI has the ability to police the Internet and, indeed,
has been doing so,” David Nadler and Kendrick
Fong, two tech-oriented lawyers, would write later on in
<cite>Computer Digest: The Journal of Professional Development
for the Washington-Baltimore Technology Community</cite>. “In
fact, the FBI has been collecting Usenet postings since the
late 1980s.”</p>

<p class='c018'>A formulaic condemnation of all FBI monitoring,
however, would be unfair. I could hardly object to the Feds
reading the public messages of egotistical nuts with a
clear-cut predilection for violence. What better reason <em>not</em>
to censor Usenet and any audio and video equivalents that
might follow? Let the kooks rant away, hour after hour,
educating Louis Freeh about their plans. Usenet wasn’t
anyone’s living room. Posting messages there was like
publishing a book or speaking in a town square. Via the
free Stanford Netnews Filtering Service, I could receive
electronic mail messages whenever a specified word
showed up in a major area of Usenet. Yes, I could track
people by name. I could also choose words associated
with a topic. That was the magic of the Net; it gave us
small-fry many of the same tools available to the intelligence
bureaucracies. The same kind of wizardry that
might let Canadian cops snoop on citizens could allow me
to track the utterances of Al Gore on the subject, say, of the
Internet.</p>

<p class='c018'>One technology, however, may have bureaucrats more
uncomfortable than any other—encryption. A U.S. database
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>expert named Patrick Ball found this out the hard
way when he was in Ethiopia to help the Office of the
Special Prosecutor. Ball efficiently helped build a database
of crimes that had occurred under the regime of Mengistu
Haile Mariam. He was accomplishing plenty. Then a bureaucratic
rival started a turf war with him. The man
falsely claimed that Ball had been using PGP for secret
correspondence, probably with the CIA, even though the
truth was a little more mundane. Ball hadn’t used PGP for
anything but test messages; the people at the other end
lacked the technical skills. But the rival didn’t know. He
confused PGP with <a id='corr259.12'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='unencoding'>uuencoding</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_259.12'><ins class='correction' title='unencoding'>uuencoding</ins></a></span>—a way to prepare programs
for accurate transmission via e-mail—and unfortunately
the chief special prosecutor believed Ball’s accuser
and forced the database expert to resign.</p>

<p class='c018'>So often that was the case with police: They displayed
a mix of fear and ignorance. And they were not totally
wrong to be worried. One computer expert predicted that
in the next few years criminals would routinely use electronic
scrambling. “This could signal the end of computer
forensics,” said William Spernow, “before it even gets off
the ground.” A criminal relied on a double set of books,
employing PGP to conceal the accurate one, and dope-peddlers
in Miami used encryption.<a id='r6.34' /><a href='#f6.34' class='c022'><sup>[6.34]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c018'>Not only that, just as I was writing part of this chapter,
the newspapers told how terrorists in Japan had killed 10
people and injured about 5,500 by spreading nerve gas in
a Tokyo subway station. Wouldn’t restrictions on encryption
make such acts harder to commit with impunity?</p>

<p class='c018'>Strong counterarguments existed, however, against the
jackbooters who would ban strong encryption or impose
the Clipper variety on us. I would rather that nations not
spy on each other. But I fully recall the naiveté of the past,
the fantasy that “gentlemen do not open other gentlemen’s
mail”; whether we liked it or not, espionage and counterespionage
would always go on. In that spirit, instead of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>wasting money on Clipperish schemes, countries could
spend money developing more powerful computers to
crack encryption, and they could also refine the unscrambling
techniques. That would not be cheap. But since bad
guys wouldn’t let Clipper or successors be the apex of technology,
the United States hadn’t any other choice. Other
countries might feel otherwise. Bureaucrats just couldn’t
contain technology. Clipperish schemes would be brainless
in any country.</p>

<p class='c018'>As one alternative, governments could rely more
heavily on open sources—for example, newspapers and
other media outlets, especially those online. The more
journalists out there, and the more independent they
were, the harder it would be for nations to keep secrets
and conspire against each other. The United States and
friends had the most selfish of reasons for encouraging
the spread of the free press.</p>

<p class='c018'>The open source idea was hardly original to me.
Others had talked about it for years, most notably Robert
Steele, the ex-CIA agent, who observed that publicly available
material was often far more useful than the clandestinely
gathered variety. I didn’t agree with much of what
Steele said—I wanted more isolation between journalists
and government than he might have liked. But his basic
point was sound. Information was most reliable when it
was in the open and could be dissected, rather than hiding
it behind a “secret” stamp. The spread of network technology
could only strengthen this premise.</p>

<p class='c018'>Yet another approach could be the selective use of
agents, in new-style roles, taking advantage of high technology.
Here again I had mixed feelings. But in an era
when countries such as Iraq were trying to develop nuclear
weapons, this option should be kept alive.</p>

<p class='c018'>What about terrorists? As with child-molesting rings
and drug cartels, Clipper just would not do any good.
Secret groups would be the last in the world to use the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>chip. Far better for intelligence agencies to work on more
powerful computers and truly effective software for cracking
codes. Breakthroughs might not come immediately,
but would sooner or later, and the civilian sector might ultimately
benefit when the technology finally did reach the
world at large. Advanced supercomputers, for example,
could be used for weather forecasting, or for graphics and
design—the same wizardry that had helped make possible
the Visible Human Project described in the last chapter.</p>

<p class='c018'>Meanwhile an open-source approach could often do
the job. The accused terrorists in Japan hadn’t exactly
stayed hidden from the world before the subway incidents.
Shoko Asahara, their leader, had delivered sermon
after sermon with allusions to poisonous gas; in the city of
Matsumoto where he had been at odds with authorities
over some land, 7 people had died and 200 had suffered
injuries when a cloud of sarin wafted in the area. Small
wonder that the Japanese government had caught up with
the sect so soon after the Tokyo tragedy. Newspaper databases
would have told plenty, beyond any information that
happened to be in the government’s own records.</p>

<p class='c018'>Legally authorized bugs might be yet another solution,
and so, at times, might be informers wired to make
the best case. In an era of near-invisible electronics, this
approach would be increasingly practical.</p>

<p class='c018'>What’s more, if Bill Clinton and Al Gore really cared
about protecting citizens in a high-tech age, they would
worry less about snooping on citizens and more about
hardening up points of vulnerability. Steele noted how
easily criminals could “maliciously interfere with the
computers that control the power system. It is relatively
easy to destroy computer capabilities—this takes much
less skill than to ‘crack’ them and divert computing resources.”
Also, terrorists could wreak havoc with computers
that controlled telephone systems in such areas as
communications for government and banking.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>He also warned of interference with the computers
of Wall Street and the Federal Reserve. “Trillions in digital
data” could vanish into the ether. “A massive global
economic panic” would ensue. Preventative measures
wouldn’t be cheap, but if the American government did
care about security, it would prepare realistically for the
threats of the information era rather than doing an inept
Big Brother act.</p>

<p class='c018'>To rig up a whole nation for wire taps would be both a
waste and a disgrace. I pondered the ironies. Here the
NSA and similar agencies were supposed to protect normality—to
guard families against dopesters, sex perverts,
terrorists, and the rest—and yet Phil Zimmermann the
husband and father might go to jail. “I think it’s kind of
unreal to him,” Zimmermann said when I asked how his
son felt about this. “I tell him that I have some talented
lawyers working for me, and that we’re doing the best we
can.” And Zimmermann’s wife? “She thinks that they
can’t possibly indict me, because that would be wrong—that
somehow they’ll realize that and just back out. Of
course by the time your book is printed, we’ll know one
way or the other whether she was right.”</p>

<p class='c018'>The White House in the 1990s was extolling computer
nets as a way to Bring Government Closer to the People.
Americans could dial up “An Interactive Citizens’ Handbook”
on the Internet, see a photo of a teenaged Clinton
with JFK, and listen to Socks the Clinton cat meow. But
could Clinton-Gore hear <em>us</em>? Just how “interactive” was
the White House?</p>

<p class='c018'>Clinton boosters formed a group called Americans
Communicating Electronically to improve electronic contacts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>between mortals and bureaucrats. Al Gore, meanwhile,
had flaunted his typing skills with the famous visit
to CompuServe. But was electronic democracy truly alive
on the Internet and other computer networks? Not quite.
All the techish sizzle notwithstanding, Clinton-Gore might
instead be giving us electronic oligarchy, especially if
Republicans followed the horrible precedents that the
White House was setting. Consider the dubious, somewhat
Orwellian process that was shaping the National Information
Infrastructure—the famous data highways and
related endeavors.</p>

<p class='c018'>So far Washington had not worked nearly as hard as it
should to drive down the cost of knowledge for the average
American. At the same time a network-hostile copyright
proposal was delighting information monopolists
and imperiling the ability of citizens to share electronic
newspaper clips in even a limited way.</p>

<p class='c018'>I testified at an official hearing on the NII in 1993, and
what most struck me about Clinton-Gore was the chasm
between words and deeds—the same mind-set that led to
Oceania’s propaganda agency being named the Ministry
of Truth. The gospel according to Al Gore was that people
of all income levels would be able to travel the dataways.
His musings later adorned the peach-colored newsprint of
<cite>The Mini Page</cite>, a newspaper insert for children.</p>

<p class='c018'>“No longer will geographical location, wealth, gender,
or any other factor limit learning,” Gore reassured elementary
schoolers. He told how “a child from my home
town of Carthage, Tennessee, will be able to come home
from school, turn on a computer, and plug into the
Library of Congress in Washington, D.C.” The NII would
clearly be in the grand democratic tradition, small “d.”</p>

<p class='c018'>The next day, however, the <cite>Washington Post</cite> carried
news of a different stripe from Bruce Lehman, the Clinton-Gore
commissioner of patents and trademarks, who chaired
the NII working group on intellectual property. I learned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>that “because of the ease of digital reproduction, Lehman
does not foresee that digital libraries will put copyrighted
works within easy reach online the way they do books on a
library shelf. Copyrighted digital materials are likely to be
available only to subscribers—libraries, for example—who
pay royalty fees, he said. People who want the material
might have to go to their local library and use a computer
there that would not allow them to copy or redistribute the
work, Lehman said.”<a id='r6.35' /><a href='#f6.35' class='c022'><sup>[6.35]</sup></a> A few months later Bruce Lehman
would graciously tell the <cite>Wall Street Journal</cite> that, yes, he
would tolerate children carrying home copyrighted CD-ROMs
and floppies of electronic books.<a id='r6.36' /><a href='#f6.36' class='c022'><sup>[6.36]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c018'>Compared to networked books, however, the CDs and
the rest would be pathetic. Distribution over the Internet
and other networks could be the cheapest way to get the
material spread around, while assuring a wide variety of
material for all. When William Buckley likened CD-ROMs
to 78-rpm shellac records in the era of the Internet, he
couldn’t have been more precise. And yet this was the future
as envisioned by Bill Clinton’s intellectual property
czar. So much for the well-informed citizenry needed for a
Jeffersonian America. Lehman was beating the bushes for
electronic oligarchy.</p>

<p class='c018'>Once I had felt that the Clinton-Gore people might
truly share my own egalitarian dreams. I’d thought that
nonlobbyists like me stood a healthy chance. I had been
writing about computers for close to a decade; earlier I
had covered a poverty beat, and I knew how we could
drive down the cost of small computers so that someday
even Head Start kids could read electronic books on them.
What better way to encourage democracy? The whole
country, not just the elite, could grow up understanding
abstract thought. Could the Constitution have been drafted
by a mob of illiterate TV watchers?</p>

<p class='c018'>Rather than letting Big Brother choose books for us,
we could establish a democratic system with many librarians
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>in many cities empowered to make acquisitions.
Never would bureaucrats be able to do the equivalent of
tweaking old copies of the <cite>London Times</cite> behind our
backs. It would be too damn hard with so many librarians
in so many locations, and with the same material reposing
on millions and millions of tablet-style computers that
individual Americans owned. My vision was one of electronic
federalism, not of Big Brother policing our reading
tastes. TeleRead wouldn’t undermine local schools and
public libraries. Quite the contrary. TeleRead would buy
affordable, sharp-screened machines for them, sending a
signal to Silicon Valley and paving the way for similar
computers to go on sale at the Kmart for $99.95 for anyone
to buy.</p>

<p class='c018'>Just as important, unlike the Postal plan mentioned
earlier in this chapter, my TeleRead plan would let
schools and libraries use the hardware without Big
Brotherish restrictions. They could store whatever they
wanted on their own computers for local people to dial
up. And to make the national library more useful at the
local level, they could add special, Web-style links designed
for the people they served—not just for whole communities,
but perhaps even for individual readers.</p>

<p class='c018'>What’s more, TeleRead would respect diversity and
freedom of expression in other ways. Publishers could
gamble fees up front to bypass librarians and qualify for
royalties, and if censored from the national library, they
could post on the Net itself. I took it for granted that
Washington would try to censor TeleRead. That was the
reason I envisioned a whole network of many librarians,
in many places, together with long-range funding. Besides,
my plan reflected the old wisdom from hackers: When
censorship arises, just route around it. Private companies
could make some nice money off officially banned books.
Imagine the promotional opportunities; “Nixed by
Washington” could be the new “Banned in Boston.” What’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>more, since TeleRead was public and involved many librarians,
not just a tiny D.C. elite, any censorship would
probably be much more conspicuous than in the world of
corporate publishing.</p>

<p class='c018'>In other ways, too, TeleRead would be anti-Big
Brother. Americans would not have to make private companies
privy to their reading habits. The national library
could track dialups for the purpose of paying writers and
publishers—you couldn’t retrieve books without reporting
past accesses. But TeleRead would include protections.
Records associated with individual users could be temporary,
just a way to prevent information providers from
abusing the system with repeated dialups. People could
buy controversial books by way of anonymous digital
money. In fact, with sophisticated enough fraud controls,
the same techniques might eventually be used to prevent
names from being associated with dialup records even for
a short time. If nothing else, people could entrust
TeleRead records to certified private companies that reported
accesses without revealing identities.</p>

<p class='c018'>TeleRead, then, could provide even more safeguards
than public library records in the paper era—significant,
since librarians by habit had respected privacy much
more than had other government officials. “There was a
case back in Nixon’s era,” Phil Zimmermann would eventually
remind me, “where Nixon tried to find out what
some of his enemies were reading at the library, and the
librarians were, of course, up in arms about being asked
to supply a list of books that had been checked out by a
particular person or a list of people that had checked out a
particular book. They were able to resist the efforts by the
government to obtain that information. I think that we
need to have the same kind of controls in place for future
libraries that are on the Net.” I couldn’t have agreed more.</p>

<p class='c018'>Even the hardware could serve to thwart Big Brother
by promoting free expression and democracy. TeleRead
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>would let people talk back to bureaucrats and among
themselves; the machines would work with keyboards,
and someday they might even serve in part as wireless
digital telephones, not just computers. TeleRead would
let Americans all be more uppity. The information in the
national library would enrich public debate; it would at
least somewhat blur distinctions between the wealthy
and those who otherwise couldn’t afford top-quality information.</p>

<p class='c018'>This needn’t be just a dream. The United States had a
$6-trillion-plus economy, and if just some of us used electronic
forms for government and commercial transactions,
we eventually would save tens of billions in time
and money. As noted earlier in this book, the same pen interfaces
that were ideal for reading would be great for
forms. E-forms could help flag errors in tax returns and
other documents, “interview” users quickly, and just as
quickly narrow down questions to the essentials. And so
the saving in time and money could easily justify a well-stocked
national library. No magic was involved here, just
an old principle of information management. Two applications
(smart forms and the electronic books) made
more sense than just one (the books). In fact, the
American Society for Information Science would later approach
me to do a chapter on electronic libraries for an
ASIS book from MIT Press, and I would oblige. Clearly
TeleRead was a logical link between Gore’s plans for reinventing
government and his oft-claimed desire to drive
down the cost of knowledge.</p>

<p class='c018'>I was a writer, not an attorney or information scientist,
but a number of well-credentialed people understood
the logic of TeleRead, even when I showed them a version
somewhat less refined than the one just described. At the
urging of a distinguished Washington lawyer, I applied
to testify at the interagency hearings on intellectual
property law in the digital age. But he warned me some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>bizarreness was afoot. Experts from the Library of
Congress would not run the hearings; nowadays electronic
books would be more within the domain of the
Commerce Department. A Commerce bureaucrat instead
would be the main player here—Bruce Lehman. That
should have been my tip-off that the proceedings would
be big and furry and jump, and come with a pocket for
joeys; but I went ahead just the same. The lawyer organizing
the hearing seemed friendly, alert, intelligent, receptive.
She said each witness would testify just a few
minutes, and that after the hearings the Feds would carefully
examine our words.</p>

<p class='c018'>My optimism grew. I expected at least a modicum of
electronic democracy, Gore-style, just as promised. So in
November 1993 I joined some thirty other witnesses in
Crystal City, Virginia, across the Potomac from Washington.
Bill Clinton wanted his presidential cabinet to look like
America, and, in fact, a black man was secretary of the
Commerce. Gazing around the room, however, I saw a sea
of white lawyers in dark suits, along with a scattering of
women in power clothes. I could have been in California at
an elite convocation of the software and entertainment industries.</p>

<p class='c018'>I ran into one of the members of the intellectual property
group, a minor White House advisor named David
Lytel, who had promised to read my proposal as sent to
him on the Internet. Mr. White House didn’t waste a
nanosecond. “This is like Hollywood,” Lytel said. “Not
everyone can be a star. We can’t use everyone’s idea.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“I’m not here to star,” I said, “just to testify. Have you
read my proposal?”</p>

<p class='c018'>He said he had seen the prepared testimony I had left
at the entrance to the auditorium.</p>

<p class='c018'>“But what about the thousands of words I sent you on
the Net? I thought you’d have a look and—”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Excuse me,” he said and moved on.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>His Hollywood analogy would strike me later as all too
apt, for this was shaping up as a TV-centric NII that favored
television and movies over books. Al Gore later
would not hold his grand information summit at the
Library of Congress; no, he would jet off to Hollywood and
to a speech punctuated by jokes with a comedienne.</p>

<p class='c018'>There in the Crystal City auditorium, I saw a tall, gray-haired
man surrounded by a cluster of other people. Heads
bobbed. Stephen Metalitz was a lawyer and a power in the
Information Industries Association, the IIA. “Welcome,
Steve,” Lehman greeted his first witness in a voice that told
me who the true star of the day was. The rest of the hearing
unfolded as I now feared. Witnesses from trade associations
pounded away at the same theme again and again.
Copyright law needed to be friendly to megaconglomerates
or they would never bless the dataways with their
<cite>Terminator</cite> films. It was as if the Internet, already starting
to bristle with small businesses, never existed.</p>

<p class='c018'>I heard some cogent testimony from some fine people
representing librarians and educators, but all in all, I
might as well have been at an IIA convention. Lehman’s
panel of bureaucrats, some of them strangers to copyright
law, just about dozed off during my testimony. Chatting
with me informally, certain industry witnesses were more
curious about my ideas than were the Feds. It wasn’t just
to size up the opposition. For my plan would divert resources
from bureaucracy to knowledge, and could actually
<em>help</em> many members of the information industry.</p>

<p class='c018'>A potential obstacle rose ahead, though: the hostility
of real, live bureaucrats.</p>

<p class='c018'>During a break I approached a working-group member
from one of the most bureaucratic agencies of them
all, the General Services Administration. “What do you
think of my ideas for electronic forms?” I asked. “I remember
when you guys let a senator benefit illegally from
a federal lease on an office building. Imagine what you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>could have done with better technology to help flag stuff
like that.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Oh,” he said coldly, “we can just train our contracting
officers better.” Better to protect jobs for bureaucrats like
him than to offer affordable e-books for schoolchildren.</p>

<p class='c018'>My foremost opponent, however, as I learned eventually,
just may have been Lehman himself—the chairman
of the Intellectual Property Working Group, which would
help set copyright policy for America’s dataways.</p>

<p class='c018'>Bruce Lehman was Mr. Politically Correct. As his heroes
he claimed the career-enhancing names of Bill
Clinton and Martin Luther King; never mind the damage
that his child-hostile copyright policies might do to ghetto
schools, or the fact that the copyright hearing had been
about as well integrated as a Klan meeting. The <cite>New York
Times</cite> would see in Lehman’s office “a handsomely
framed photograph taken at last year’s White House
Christmas party. Bill and Hillary Clinton stand in the middle.
Mr. Lehman is to the left, under a portrait of George
Washington.”</p>

<p class='c018'>His clothes were as aggressively fashionable as his
choice of heroes. The <cite>Times</cite>’s Teresa Riordan would write
of “stylish suits detailed with a fresh white handkerchief.”
He might display “a touch of exotic color, perhaps a mint-colored
watchband or the ruby background of a Brooks
Brother tie.”<a id='r6.37' /><a href='#f6.37' class='c022'><sup>[6.37]</sup></a> Lehman needn’t haunt any thrift shops.
During a twelve- to fourteen-month period before joining
the Administration, he had pulled down $430,000 as a lobbyist
and lawyer for intellectual property clients.<a id='r6.38' /><a href='#f6.38' class='c022'><sup>[6.38]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c018'>The patent office’s Web site said he had represented
“individuals, companies, and trade associations in the
area of intellectual property rights as it affects the motion
picture, telecommunications, pharmaceutical, computer
software, and broadcasting industries.”<a id='r6.39' /><a href='#f6.39' class='c022'><sup>[6.39]</sup></a> His clients had
included Lotus and Microsoft.<a id='r6.40' /><a href='#f6.40' class='c022'><sup>[6.40]</sup></a> The latter was buying up
electronic rights as if they were soft drinks for the programmers’
offices. No, Microsoft would hardly be the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>world’s leading backer of a universally affordable, well-stocked
national digital library of the TeleRead variety. I’d
lobby anyone, any company, for my idea. But could I ever
persuade Microsoft? Oh, come on. This was the company
that owned the word “Windows.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Clinton-Gore campaigners had once talked of “People
First.” Based on Lehman’s background and proclivities,
however, a better motto in the case of intellectual property
might now be “Entertainment, Information, and Software
Magnates First.” It was as if Clinton-Gore had turned national
health policy over to a zealous insurance lobbyist
who had spent years crusading for higher premiums.</p>

<p class='c018'>Even at the local level, Lehman was no stranger to the
world of money and politics. In 1991, while a Georgetown
lawyer, he had lent $10,000 at 12 percent interest to
Washington city council candidate Jim Zais even though
local law apparently restricted candidates to borrowing
only from the usual lending institutions. Zais at the time
had raised less than $13,000 from other sources. Questioned
by election officials, the candidate had claimed ignorance
of the law and promptly paid the money back to
Lehman, along with some $120 in interest.<a id='r6.41' /><a href='#f6.41' class='c022'><sup>[6.41]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c018'>Like many of his ex-colleagues at Swidler &amp; Berlin,
Lehman had kept his checkbook wide open when national
politicians needed money. Many months later I
learned that between January 1, 1991, and November 28,
1994, the S &amp; B crowd had made at least $191,000 in political
donations, including more than $22,000 from
Lehman himself during his days there. At least $146,000
of the $191,000 had gone to the firm’s political-action
committee. Lehman’s personal contributions had
reached at least eighteen congressional candidates. In
fairness, let me emphasize that Lehman didn’t just have
direct career considerations in mind—he was the first
openly gay man whom the U.S. Senate had confirmed as
a top federal official,<a id='r6.42' /><a href='#f6.42' class='c022'><sup>[6.42]</sup></a> and he had given generously to
gay political-action committees.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>Gay groups, in turn, showed their loyalty. They had
wanted Clinton to appoint Bruce Lehman to <em>something</em>,
and the White House had made him patent commissioner
even though Lehman knew more about copyrights. Ron
Brown, however, secretary of Commerce, said: “Bruce
Lehman is not here because he’s gay. He’s the absolutely
best person for the job.”<a id='r6.43' /><a href='#f6.43' class='c022'><sup>[6.43]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c018'>I believed Brown. If the Clinton Administration
wanted library interests to be kept at bay to placate rich
campaign donors, Gore’s dreamy rhetoric notwithstanding,
no one would beat Lehman the ex-lobbyist.</p>

<p class='c018'>A few weeks after the intellectual property hearing in
Crystal City, a letter arrived from Mr. Reinventing
Government himself. I had mailed my TeleRead proposal
and a related <cite>Washington Post</cite> clip to Al Gore many
months ago in spring 1993, and now he replied: “I am impressed
with this detailed and very professional presentation.
The information you provided certainly appears to
contain ideas that merit careful attention. I will retain this
material for future consideration as the President and I
work on related policies and programs.” I hardly expected
a meeting with Clinton and Gore. But was it just possible
that one of their GS-14s might deem me worth five minutes
of time, and follow up with a few questions?</p>

<p class='c018'>Months passed. An occasional reporter or academic
would read my testimony and call or e-mail, but no one
phoned from Commerce. Meanwhile, seeing my TeleRead
proposal on the Net, major vendors contacted me. Often
they asked the big question: “How are you doing in
Washington?”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Well,” I said in effect, “I hope they’re keeping an open
mind.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“That’s nice, bye,” the answers would more or less
come back—assuming I heard again from people at all.
The NII wasn’t just TV-centric. It was Gore-centric. If you
lacked his blessing, and his bland letter to me didn’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>count, you were dead or at least comatose unless the right
word from the White House revived your idea.</p>

<p class='c018'>Then a “Green Paper” revealing the Clinton Administration’s
preliminary views on data highways and copyright
came out. It was even more horrid than I could have
imagined, an insult to the memory of Andrew Carnegie.
The ethos was exactly the opposite of TeleRead’s. For example,
if the paper became law, one could not transmit a
newspaper article to a few friends; the present ambiguities
here would be resolved in favor of the copyright holders.
Yes, Washington should not allow anyone to bootleg newspaper
stories or magazine items for hundreds of people in
an electronic discussion group. In fact, I’d once reported a
gross offender to a magazine; I believed passionately in
property rights. Clearly electronic books, of all media,
should enjoy protection, which, in fact, TeleRead would
promote by making piracy less lucrative. But we also had
to understand the purpose of copyright law—to help
spread information in a democracy and further the
progress of science and the arts. Lehman either was disingenuous
or had let his old $430,000 make him a little amnesic
toward Constitutional tradition.</p>

<p class='c018'>Ironically, if Lehman’s side won out, writers and journalists
would be among the biggest victims of the very law
designed to protect us. After all, we were not just producers
of information; we were also consumers. To write a
book I would absorb millions of words from the Internet,
swapping information with friend after friend along the
way, including, yes, some electronic newspaper clips. But
the Green Paper bizarrely flouted the natural tendency of
most people to <em>share</em>. Imagine the effect on teachers and
children. Quite rightly, Jim Warren observed that
Washington was cheating the public “to avoid controversy
among ‘important’ people.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“The Draft Report comes down firmly on the side of increased
rights for copyright owners in all relevant contexts,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>endorsing the goal of enhanced copyright protection without
acknowledging any countervailing concerns,” wrote
Jessica Litman, a law professor at Detroit’s Wayne State
University. In a reply to the Administration she said of the
report: “It appears to be an advocacy document: It at times
misrepresents the state of current law, and gives voice to
only one side of complicated policy debates.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Another expert, law professor Pamela Samuelson at
the University of Pittsburgh, lambasted the Green Paper in
an article for <cite>Communications of the ACM</cite>, published by
the Association for Computing Machinery. She said that
“not since the King of England in the sixteenth century
gave a group of printers exclusive rights to print books in
exchange for the printers’ agreement not to print heretical
or seditious material has a government copyright policy
been so skewed in favor of publisher interests and so detrimental
to the public interest.” Contrary to Washington’s
claim, the Green Paper was not just a tweaking of existing
law but a radical revision in favor of publishers.<a id='r6.44' /><a href='#f6.44' class='c022'><sup>[6.44]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c018'>Directly Orwellian questions arose. What about enforcement?
How to thwart the ease of mailing copies over
the Net? The Green Paper’s designers thought that laws
against circumventing copy protection would provide one
of the main answers. But in the case of electronic text, such
visions were far too sanguine. People would want the capability
to print out material, and if they could print it out,
they could scan it and put it online again without the protection
feature; what’s more, hackers would inevitably develop
software to accomplish the same thing electronically.</p>

<p class='c018'>Yes, the Green Paper would let publishers and others
sue makers of devices that could get around copy protection.
But just what gear was covered? Scanners? Fax machines?
And what kinds of software? What about
legitimate programs that also had illicit uses? Were we the
new Soviets, living in fear of the digital equivalent of
copiers and other subversive gadgets? As William Buckley
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>would write, “fax machines and e-mail outwitted and
frustrated even the comprehensive revolutionary orders
of Stalin and Mao. This side of what used to be the Iron
Curtain, we should have the resources to handle our native
bureaucracy.” The Green Paper was nothing more
than Big Bureaucracy trying to serve Big Business.</p>

<p class='c018'>The Green Paper had much in common with Clipper.
In both cases bureaucrats were reducing respect for
Washington by trying to control the uncontrollable. I was
hardly a kneejerker crying out for a pigmy-sized government.
My liberalism remained. I favored prenatal nutrition
programs, Head Start, public broadcasting, and a
host of other wonderful anachronisms from the heyday of
the Democrats. And yet here was the Clinton Administration
blundering along in the most obnoxious way
and turning so many of my fellow liberals on the Internet
into libertarians.</p>

<p class='c018'>If nothing else, the White House was complicating my
job of trying to sell the Net on TeleRead. It was not just a
question of preempting my idea in favor of an inferior solution
rigged up for Clinton’s powerful friends in entertainment
and publishing. Like Clipper, the Green Paper
was lessening faith in Washington, period—no small concern
for somebody advocating a national program such as
TeleRead, even one developed with local sensibilities in
mind. Sometimes I wondered if Lehman might be a
Manchurian Patent Commissioner.<a id='r6.45' /><a href='#f6.45' class='c022'><sup>[6.45]</sup></a> Had the Libertarians
brainwashed him to sully Washington’s good name?</p>

<p class='c018'>Again and again I flamed Lehman’s Green Paper on
alt.activism and at least half a dozen other newsgroups on
the Internet. I hadn’t any choice. He hated the bytes-want-to-be-free
philosophy of TeleRead. Clearly, if Lehman had
read TeleRead, it would have driven him nuts, given his
apparent belief that copyrighted books must <em>cost</em> readers.
TeleRead, on the other hand, would mean fair treatment
of copyright holders and library users alike. With a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>TeleRead-style library, publishers, writers, and private
nets could still charge for many categories of information
and earn handsome sums from online conferences and
other services and products, including customized software
to guide people through electronic libraries. Also,
they would receive fair royalties for covered material such
as books. At the same time, however, thanks to the cost
justification provided by the e-forms, we could make electronic
books free in this TV-fixated era and thus encourage
literacy.</p>

<p class='c018'>Surely TeleRead could be a logical link between
Gore’s plans for reinventing government and his oft-claimed
desire to drive down the cost of knowledge. With
TeleRead, the old scarcities could be obsolete; rich and
poor could dial up the same books. It would be a far cry
from the present when Beverly Hills spent many times
more on library materials than did some poorer jurisdictions.
TeleRead was not a cure-all; but in an era of tight
budgets, the national library could be phased in carefully,
year by year, topic by topic, with minimal pain. The reduction
of expensive, onerous paperwork would be like a
tax rebate. For once, a program could simultaneously
help schoolchildren and small business people.</p>

<p class='c018'>Perhaps the NII Advisory Council would see merit in
TeleRead. The White House didn’t necessarily have to follow
its recommendations, but wasn’t this the age of electronic
democracy and citizens’ input? A few problems had
arisen, however. Bill Clinton’s people had tolerated just
one librarian among the more than thirty members of the
Council. An overworked teacher was there representing
education. But no full-time professional writers of books,
and just one newspaper publisher, had ended up tainting
the Advisory Council.</p>

<p class='c018'>Nor did any name show up from a distinguished publishing
firm such as Knopf or Farrar, Straus and Giroux.
Instead the White House blessed the NII with Vance
Opperman, a friend of Al Gore’s and a money man for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>Democratic Party,<a id='r6.46' /><a href='#f6.46' class='c022'><sup>[6.46]</sup></a> who was president of West Publishing.
By one estimate West grossed some $600 million a
year with pretax margins of almost 30 percent, or twice
those of rivals.<a id='r6.47' /><a href='#f6.47' class='c022'><sup>[6.47]</sup></a> West-style firms were famous for
Cadillac-priced data. Opperman’s company had set up
collections of court opinions and slapped a proprietary
system of citations on them. The meter typically ran at $4
a minute or more, adding up to millions from Feds and
taxpayers alike.</p>

<p class='c018'>Haunted by a group called the Taxpayer Assets Project,
the Justice Department had proposed an electronic database
with public-domain citations to help users locate
material. But West had lobbied away the plans. Nothing
must deprive Al Gore’s friend, and so many other politicians’
friend, of a chance to turn a buck. Opperman
seemed about as eager to drive down the cost of knowledge
as Bull Connor was to further civil rights in the days
of cattle prods and police dogs.</p>

<p class='c018'>At the same time the Advisory Council teemed with
people from such library-like outfits as CBS, Black
Entertainment Television, and Walt Disney. Bill Clinton’s
people also let the movie industry’s premier lobbyist sit on
the council—Jack Valenti, a former aide to Lyndon
Johnson; yes, the same Valenti who had made history
years ago by sleeping better at night because, he said, LBJ
was in the White House. To the Council, too, went powerful
telephone executives, a man from Microsoft, and John
Scully, the former Apple executive who had been a
Clinton stalwart in ’92. A co-chair was a Clinton supporter
named Ed McCracken. He came from Silicon Graphics, a
billion-dollar company that was hoping to make a fortune
off the new video technology.</p>

<p class='c018'>Clearly entertainment was what counted most here.
The term National Information Infrastructure just didn’t
suffice. A more accurate description, given the paucity of
librarians, educators, and journalists on the council, would
have been the National <cite>Entertainment</cite> Infrastructure. Yes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>people like Vance Opperman were interested in electronic
text, but, above all, from a business perspective. Let the
masses watch TV. His company would make a fortune selling
pricey information to the elite.</p>

<p class='c018'>Mass literacy just wasn’t the main show here, not with
all the dutiful suits watching out for the earnings of CBS
or Disney or Microsoft or West, and without enough librarians
and others to balance them out.</p>

<p class='c018'>A host of other issues remained. How fascinating that
so many of the most influential people in the Clinton
galaxy were from outfits such as telephone companies
that wanted to profit off both transmission and content.
Despite all the rhetoric, I wondered how attentive the
Clintonians would be to, say, little companies that were
more interested in producing books or folk albums than
in financing <cite>Terminators</cite> or laying fiber optic cables.</p>

<p class='c018'>Could money and politics have mattered just a little in
the selection of people for the NII Advisory Council? If
nothing else, a few questions arose in the case of West
Publishing, the giant publisher of legal information.
Vance Opperman was friends with Mack McLarty,
Clinton’s first chief of staff.<a id='r6.48' /><a href='#f6.48' class='c022'><sup>[6.48]</sup></a> What’s more, Opperman
cochaired the finance committee during the 1994 reelection
campaign of Dianne Feinstein, a Democratic U.S.
senator from California who sat on a copyright subcommittee
within the Judiciary Committee.<a id='r6.49' /><a href='#f6.49' class='c022'><sup>[6.49]</sup></a> A study by the
Taxpayer Assets Project, one of Ralph Nader’s groups, revealed
how civic-minded West was. By way of a political-action
committee and gifts from lawyers, lobbyists, and
family members, the West crowd in five years had given
more than $738,000 to Congress members and the
Democratic National Committee.</p>

<p class='c018'>Judges, too, must have loved the company. A West-run
foundation had dispensed $15,000 awards to federal judges
for “distinguished service to justice.” Over a dozen years,
the selection committee had included seven past or present
members of the U.S. Supreme Court, the ultimate interpreter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>of copyright law. West had paid for trips to places
as far off as Hawaii and the Virgin Islands. Benefiting, according
to the <cite>Minneapolis Star Tribune</cite>, were Justices
Anthony Kennedy, Sandra Day O’Connor, John Paul
Stevens, Antonin Scalia, and now-retired Justices Lewis
Powell, Byron White, and William Brennan.<a id='r6.50' /><a href='#f6.50' class='c022'><sup>[6.50]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c018'>West impressed me. Via campaign gifts, friends, and
favors such as the trips, Opperman’s crew had cozied up
to all three branches of government—the executive, the
legislative, and the judiciary.</p>

<p class='c018'>Eager to see how representative West was with its
people’s political gifts, I phoned the Center for Responsive
Politics, the Washington-based group from which I simultaneously
got information about Lehman. Would the
Center please send me a printout of congressional and
presidential donations from some other members of the
NII Advisory Council and from people and political-action
committees associated with their companies?</p>

<p class='c018'>A list arrived for the period between January 1, 1991,
and November 28, 1994, and I scanned down the names on
the laser-printed sheets. The Walt Disney people hadn’t disappointed
me. Advisory Council member John F. Cooke,
president of the Disney Channel, had given at least $48,000
to politicians from coast to coast and to Democratic organizations.
Non-Council member Jeffrey Katzenberg, then
with the Disney conglomerate, had donated at least $63,000
in one way or another.</p>

<p class='c018'>I saw <em>at least</em> $400,000 in Disney-related gifts—donations
from top executives were just the start. Cook and
Katzenberg on their own couldn’t sway the White House
and Congress, nor even could all of Disney; but imagine
what Hollywood and other rich industries could do en
masse to influence copyright and telecommunications policies.
What counted most wasn’t the person but the industry.
At one recent gathering at Steven Spielberg’s mansion—in
spring 1995, a time not covered by the laser-printed sheet—Bill
Clinton had raised $50,000 per couple.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>Whatever the case, the stray change added up. Over at
MCA, Advisory Council member Alvin Teller gave at least
$28,250 between early 1991 and late 1994, while Lew
Wasserman, a nonmember, gave at least $87,000. Advisory
Council member Jack Valenti, Hollywood’s big lobbyist in
D.C., donated at least $56,250.</p>

<p class='c018'>Advisory Council member Stanley Hubbard, chairman
and chief executive of Hubbard Broadcasting in Minnesota,
also made a good showing. He and relatives gave at least
$74,000 to people on the Hill, political-action committees,
and the Democratic Party. Confronted with $1,000-per-election
limits on political gifts to members of Congress,
Hubbard just spread his money around, as if using greenbacks
like calling cards. His donations reached powers
such as Representative Ed Markey of Massachusetts, who,
until the Republican victory in 1994, chaired the House
Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance. Many
saw Markey as one of the more progressive NII players.
Just think, however, what such politicians could have
done without the distractions of special-interest money—donations
not only to them but also to colleagues who
would be more susceptible to pressure.</p>

<p class='c018'>Telephone executives made the NII sugar-daddies list,
of course. Advisory Council member Bert Roberts Jr.,
MCI’s chairman and CEO, gave at least $28,000 to an MCI
political-action committee and to politicians, ranging
from Senator Bob Packwood to, yes, Edward Markey. A
supporting cast came from the ranks of the MCI employees,
including one of my techie heroes, Vint Cerf, “Mr.
Internet,” who contributed at least $1,000 to the same PAC
as Roberts.</p>

<p class='c018'>Advisory Council member James Houghton of Corning
Glass donated more than $50,000 to members of Congress
across the country, and to party, presidential, and PAC
funds. Corning, of course, was rooting for fiberglass cable—a
rival in some ways to wireless technology, which some
on the Internet considered the future.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>No, the millionaires on the Advisory Council had not
committed crimes or bribed anyone. Under the law, they
had a right to give massive amounts to campaigns as long
as each gift did not exceed the legal limits. To my knowledge
no money had come from anyone’s corporate tills,
just from individuals and the political-action committees
to which they had lawfully contributed. Besides, just like
Lehman, many other rich donors must have had the most
heartfelt of reasons for personal donations, going far beyond
copyright and telecommunications issues. Even
though copyright holders had donated to many well-positioned
politicians such as Senator Dianne Feinstein,
who was active on intellectual property matters, that was
hardly the only reason why Hollywood millionaires gave.
The woman was a California Democrat. Many people at
companies such as MCA were the same. If a Californian, I
myself might have voted for her.</p>

<p class='c018'>Likewise, the people of West Publishing must have
had varied motives in contributing.<a id='r6.51' /><a href='#f6.51' class='c022'><sup>[6.51]</sup></a> Vance Opperman
was a former antiwar protester and probably still saw
himself as a force for social good. I suspected, too, that he
loved seeing his old friend Al Gore grow in power. At the
1992 Democratic Convention Opperman had described
himself as a “political junkie” who enjoyed hosting political
receptions for fun. “I don’t expect to get any political
benefits out of them.”<a id='r6.52' /><a href='#f6.52' class='c022'><sup>[6.52]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c018'>Replying on February 22, 1995, to questions from the
<cite>Minneapolis Star Tribune</cite>, Opperman’s company noted
that all donations were legal and on record at the Federal
Election Commission. “It appears that you believe the
laws regarding these matters should be changed,” West
said. “If so, the proper thing for you to do is to seek to
change these laws rather than criticize those who carefully
comply with existing law.” The company denied any
efforts to influence officials improperly. West said that its
employees, its political-action committee, and its counsel
all had “long histories of being active in the political
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>process. It is inaccurate to tie their donations over the
past 20 years to any specific issue of legislation pending
before a government body. Your inference that such donations
have been made as one collective effort is also totally
untrue.”<a id='r6.53' /><a href='#f6.53' class='c022'><sup>[6.53]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c018'>West pointed out to the <cite>Star Tribune</cite> that people from
rival information companies were also making contributions.
But of course! Money always counted in politics.
Vance Opperman had put it well several years ago as
head of Opperman Heins &amp; Paquin, a leading law firm
notable for PAC gifts to Minneapolis politicians. “If we
have those who oppose the interests of our clients,” he
said, “we do not support them.” He said the law firm’s
PAC ran under this philosophy: “Support your friends.
Punish your enemies.”<a id='r6.54' /><a href='#f6.54' class='c022'><sup>[6.54]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c018'>Presumably Bill Clinton and Al Gore would rather
avoid punishment from the Oppermans of this nation.
While almost ignoring librarians and educators, the
Administration had appointed to its Advisory Council some
members of the elite who were already over-represented in
the political process. Did Vance Opperman, as a friend of
Gore’s, really have to worry about the Vice President reading
<em>his</em> letters? I wouldn’t have been surprised if he had
Gore’s private e-mail address. Just how many electronic
entreaties to the Hill, or to the Clinton-Gore area on the
Web, would it take to neutralize the little fortune donated
by friends of West Publishing? I couldn’t have agreed
more with Cliff Stoll when he wrote that Washington often
ignored citizens’ e-mail. It all figured. The Power People
were too busy raising donations from millionaires and political-action
committees—hardly the biggest champions
of low-cost knowledge.</p>

<p class='c018'>Granted, some optimists hoped that the Internet itself
could help turn around Washington. Aided by the Net, a
group in Washington State had gathered $26,000 to help defeat
Tom Foley, then the Democratic Speaker of the House.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>And NewtWatch, an anti-Gingrich effort on the World
Wide Web, had registered as a political-action committee.
Some members of both major parties were hoping to use
the Net to raise money efficiently from small donors.<a id='r6.55' /><a href='#f6.55' class='c022'><sup>[6.55]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c018'>That was far from a full answer, though. Even before I
learned of all the campaign cash from some members of
the Advisory Council, I had wondered about the group’s
odd composition. Not everyone on the council was rich, of
course, far from it. But why had business prevailed so
brazenly over the general public and Al Gore’s little
neighbor back in Tennessee, the one who was supposed
to dial up books from the Library of Congress regardless
of family income? Just one teacher and one librarian? In
politer language I’d sent the question on to a White House
staffer, and he had patiently explained to me that
Washington had to serve the needs of the “stakeholders.”</p>

<p class='c018'>I loved the word. It sounded so innocent, so natural, so
philosophical. What if this were eighteenth-century France,
the revolution were on, and Marie Antoinette looked like
guillotine fodder? Armed with such a marvelous locution,
she could forego all references to bread and cake and
simply say, “Stop! I’m one of the stakeholders.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Now having documented a nice flow of money from
“stakeholders” to politicians, especially Democrats, I remembered
how many Watergate-era ambassadorships
had gone to the highest bidders. Wasn’t the same ethos at
work here as Richard Nixon’s? I knew of no broken
laws—but perhaps that was the trouble.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I remember when I got on Energy and Commerce,
everybody jumped for the Telecommunications Subcommittee
first,” Peter Kostmayer, a former Democratic representative
from Pennsylvania, said as quoted by veteran
political journalist Martin Schram. “There was a member
sitting next to me, and every time another member bid for
that committee, he went ‘Ding!’—as if a cash register was
going off.”<a id='r6.56' /><a href='#f6.56' class='c022'><sup>[6.56]</sup></a> When politicians talked about the need for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>election reform and clean, ethical government, many
were themselves superb examples of the need for action.</p>

<p class='c018'>Maybe, I’d thought earlier, I could at least enjoy an
open-minded hearing from a nonmillionaire on the Advisory
Council. Bonnie Bracey was the only elementary
school teacher. She should have loved TeleRead.</p>

<p class='c018'>But during an official virtual conference organized on
the Net by the Commerce Department, she went after not
Opperman but <em>me</em>. “I am not the least interested in the
TeleReader,” she said in a public message, “and I don’t
have any money after trying to do this job to invest anyway.”
I was and am a writer. Last I knew, I had not been
selling computers. Bracey needed to scrutinize my proposal.
Maybe she could then dismiss it as a nefarious
writer’s plot. TeleRead did, after all, propose a massive
shifting of resources from bureaucracy to various forms of
knowledge, including—<em>gasp!</em>—electronic <em>books</em>.</p>

<p class='c018'>At times, Bracey would e-mail me that my proposal intrigued
her, but somehow she would never get around to
<em>study</em> it, or at least to telling me that she had gone beyond
summaries. She would repeat the usual clichés that citizens
didn’t want to spend money on schools. Toward
TeleRead’s cost-justification mechanisms, toward the support
that it could win among frugal, business-oriented
conservatives such as William Buckley, she was unresponsive.
Granted, she wasn’t callous about the children
TeleRead could help. At the personal level she had been
exemplary, spending hundreds and perhaps thousands of
dollars on hardware and software that she could use in
her classes. But TeleRead for her could have been a
bother. Offensively, perhaps, it meant a national library
online for all, regardless of whether they happened to be
students anywhere.</p>

<p class='c018'>TeleRead, however, was hardly antischool, given all
the new possibilities it could open up online for teachers
and students. Looking back, I just wished that Bracey had
seen a note I received from a teacher in Illinois who had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>asked more than sixty magazines for permission to
reprint articles for her small class at no profit. Only
twenty-five publications had gone along. “We were ignored
sometimes,” the woman had e-mailed me, “and
once I was told, by phone, never to use any articles from
that publication. That was <cite>Windows Magazine</cite>, and I
didn’t renew my subscription.” Of her anthology, she had
said: “It’s a better textbook because it’s more up to date.”
Clearly we could never separate “educational” uses of the
NII from the rest; an article from a commercial magazine
could actually prove so much more valuable than an instantly
obsolete textbook. TeleRead would make back issues
of magazines available for free, make current ones
easier to obtain, and, above all, allow free textbooks to be
updated instantly, complete with hypertext links to the
rest of the national library.</p>

<p class='c018'>But predictably the NII Advisory Council ignored
TeleRead and more or less green-lighted the Green
Paper. The council for the most part came out in favor of
publishers enjoying control over transmission rights. In
effect these people were kissing off the idea of a comprehensive,
cost-justified library that all Americans could afford
to use online, whether for school or for self-improvement.
As I was concluding this book, it wasn’t
certain that the Green Paper would slither its way into
law in more or less the original form. But the news from
Capitol Hill didn’t cheer me. The Republican Congress
appeared to be at least as skewed in favor of copyright
holders as were the Democrats.</p>

<p class='c018'>Even diluted (and renamed the White Paper in the
final version), the Green Paper might well be a disgrace.
I worried about the rest of the world. Imagine the
Australians or Europeans looking to the United States for
leadership in Net-related copyright matters. To me, the
Green Paper bore the stains of greenbacks. People around
D.C. had a polite little word, “access.” It didn’t mean legal
violations, but rather purchases of policymakers’ ears.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>Information magnates had access. I wondered if the little
child in Al Gore’s hometown gave so faithfully to major
politicians, flew Supreme Court justices to Hawaii, and
doled out $15,000 “justice” awards.</p>

<p class='c018'>The Green Paper, alas, was just one indication of
many big shots’ willingness to work against the citizenry.
Again and again the denizens of Capitol Hill bragged
about Americans being able to dial up the text of proposed
legislation through a service called Thomas. And yet some
Congress members still hoped to work out deals before
the public saw the results on the Net. Friends of West
Publishing used exactly such tactics on the Hill to try to
reduce the amount of information that the government released
for free. West and similar companies wanted to be
able to profit off public data. So their congressional allies
were hoping to cancel out the Freedom of Information Act
in cases where federal contractors had created records.</p>

<p class='c018'>Any weakening of the act would make me <em>very</em>
grouchy; it had opened up many kind of government information
for free or at affordable costs. I had benefited.
Two decades ago the General Services Administration had
tried unsuccessfully to charge me $20,000 to learn details
about the government’s office-leasing program. Using this
first-class muck, I had shown that then-Senator Abraham
Ribicoff secretly owned a stake in a building that the GSA
leased for the Central Intelligence Agency. I had learned,
too, of a friend of Spiro Agnew who had been able to avoid
building a half-million-dollar cafeteria required by the
lease for the headquarters building of the Environmental
Protection Agency. Because of the Information Act, I had
been able to report both stories and get them out in the
press and on network television. I had spent months
camped out at the GSA, perusing documents; imagine
what I could have done with a computer to ferret out digitized
muck. And so I was dismayed to learn that some in
Congress wanted to weaken the Information Act—this in
an era when the Internet supposedly would open up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>Washington. If not fully Orwellian, such hypocrisy didn’t
promote democratic alternatives to Big Brother.</p>

<p class='c018'>Uppity activists used the Net to thwart West at least for
the moment. A bill introduced by Representative William
Clinger, a Republican from Pennsylvania, was to be heard
in a subcommittee and rushed through a committee edit
in just a few days with West-friendly provisions. But
James Love of the Taxpayer Assets Project caught wind of
the shenanigans; Jim Warren pitched in with his own jeremiads
in <cite>Government Access</cite>, his online newsletter; and
furious Netfolks called and faxed the Hill. West may have
really lost when the Republicans found out through the
Internet about the firm’s generosity toward the <cite>Democratic
Party</cite>, to which its executives gave far more than to
the competition. “Why are we doing this?” the Republicans,
in effect, may have wondered.</p>

<p class='c018'>Only because of some extraordinary diligence by Love
and allies did the public win here. Newt Gingrich could
talk all he wanted about the Net putting citizens and lobbyists
on an equal footing, but without a constant watch
on the Hill, scene of so many crimes, the same power
cliques would keep winning again and again, banana-republic
fashion. West might yet succeed.</p>

<p class='c018'>Around this same time, Sally Katzen, a top bureaucrat
with Clinton’s Office of Management and Budget had
asked Congress to make certain that the Feds could
charge more for information in some cases than the cost
of spreading it. They would be able to do this after posting
notices in the <cite>Federal Register</cite>. And then, if insufficient
protests ensued, the info-gouges could begin. Katzen’s
proposal didn’t fly, but its very existence was bothersome
enough. The idea hardly jibed with all the nice rhetoric
from the White House about using the Net to promote
open government. So much for freedom of information,
Clinton style.</p>

<p class='c018'>Meanwhile I forged ahead with my TeleRead efforts,
perhaps not for this Congress and this White House, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>maybe for those in the future—once enough voters understood
that we mustn’t replicate online the “savage inequalities”
of our schools and libraries. TeleRead if nothing else
was a handy litmus test to find out which policymakers
were sincere when they talked about the need for true
public libraries in cyberspace, as opposed to just digital
storefronts with links to publishers. Good people could
disagree with me. But when politicians and their flunkies
did not bother to hear me out despite my idea’s credentials,
I was reminded of how democratic Washington was
toward Power People and how oligarchic it was toward
the rest of the cosmos. Sometimes I felt that my location,
in Alexandria, Virginia, was metaphorical. My apartment
was just inside the Washington Beltway.</p>

<p class='c018'>The question of the moment wasn’t just one of copyright.
It was also one of democracy itself, both the decision
process and the aftermath. What about the Copyright
Gestapo? In the future might the Feds monitor the activities
of Republicans more closely than they would those of
Democrats? Would Republicans be more susceptible to
charges of intellectual piracy when they did the inevitable
and tried to share old newspaper clips over the Net? Or
vice versa? Would the Democrats suffer discrimination?
What about Italy, where the machine-gun-toting cops had
invoked software piracy laws against leftist bulletin boards
but not against conservative ones? But the Clintonians, so
eager to serve their political friends, were just as cavalier
toward these possibilities as toward the civil liberties risk
of Clipper.</p>

<p class='c018'>Ultimately the copyright-holders’ victory just might be
Pyrrhic. Someday the political terrain could shift and millions
of children might grow up on free, government-commissioned
books. Or, perhaps instead, videos in too
many cases would replace text. So we were better off if, as
soon as possible, we used networks to spread <em>privately</em> originated
books through a free, well-stocked library system.
TeleRead could indeed help many in the information industry.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>From Lexis-Nexis to Random House, companies
could turn profits off dial-up fees, either from works they
commissioned directly or from rights they bought from
authors. TeleRead wasn’t a threat to information companies
if they truly added value such as editing or marketing.
Even West could benefit. TeleRead would let
Opperman’s company reap many millions off dial-up
rights—not only to legal writings but also to other kinds—if
the market favored it.</p>

<p class='c018'>No, the real losers would be the bureaucrats, whose
work, after all, would be less in demand in an era of electronic
forms in mass use. And even they could have a soft
landing. TeleRead would hardly take place instantly, and
it would remove much of the scut work from the remaining
jobs in government. TeleRead was anti-bureaucracy,
not anti-bureaucrat. For the moment, however, as shown
by the obtuseness of the GSA man at the hearing, the resistance
was there.</p>

<p class='c018'>Some lessons were emerging. Hundreds of people had
e-mailed me for copies of TeleRead. “Even anti-taxers like
me would be willing to foot the bill for something so practical
and knowledge infectious,” a home schooler in
Illinois had said. The head of the Digital Publishing
Association, an organization consisting mostly of small
publishers and writers, had loved TeleRead. “Instead of
flooding the young mind with yet another sitcom or soap,”
he had said, “TeleRead would allow video to present them
with quality reading materials.” And yet our wishes had
not meant squat.</p>

<p class='c018'>David Lytel, the White House staffer, may have
pressed his delete key almost as soon as the TeleRead proposal
reached him over the Net. He and his colleagues at
the Lehman hearings hadn’t followed up my official testimony
with a single question in person or by phone or
e-mail. The hearings had been a big farce, a caricature of
a public relations exercise. I might as well have been
Winston Smith deviating from the plot and making a few
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>friendly suggestions to one of Big Brother’s TV cameras.
No one would shoot or torture me for saying the wrong
things, but on the major NII issues the Clinton people
were about as open as Big Brother to ideas from below,
Net or no Net.</p>

<p class='c018'>I wasn’t the only writer with a few feelings on the subject
of Executive listening skills in this networked era. A
<cite>New York Times</cite> columnist later told how cavalier the
White House crowd had been toward the e-mail from her.
I’d actually gotten farther than she had. At least Gore had
sent me a higher class of boilerplate. Perhaps that was because
I had actually used conventional rather than electronic
mail, and had enclosed a photocopy of a TeleRead
article from the <cite>Washington Post</cite>. Article or not, however,
the White House had thumbed its nose at me. While
Clinton and Gore couldn’t reply to every citizen, the composition
of the citizens’ advisory council had made clear
what the NII priorities were, even in the age of Cyber
Socks: Big Government serving Big Business.</p>

<p class='c018'>Clinton-Gore had better change if they wanted my
vote in ’96. Rather than just sharing Sock’s meows and
feeling ever so smug about high-tech democracy, they
needed to spend time more listening to us nonlobbyists
and a little less time keeping Vance Opperman happy.
Democracy should not mean just a dialogue between the
White House and the usual “stakeholders.”</p>

<hr class='c032' />

<p class='c018'>As is obvious by now, intrusive government officials
love to fixate on net.sex. But something else is happening
as shown in the next chapter: net.<em>love</em>. Let’s hope that
Exon and company can tell the difference.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c017'>Gregory Smith* had yet to kiss Susan Olson* good
night or run his fingers through her hair. But he
could do something else with his fingers: type to
her. Greg was a library and information-management student
in Adelaide in South Australia, she worked for a real
estate firm in Kansas City, Missouri, and they were carrying
on a romance by way of the Internet. “We write letters
constantly,” he said, “and exchange our thoughts on
newspaper clippings, music, all manner of things. About
the only thing we haven’t exchanged are marriage vows.”</p>

<p class='c018'>The outcome, as I began this chapter, wasn’t clear. If
the Smith-Olson affair was like many on the Net, they
would pull the plug long before all the typing destroyed
their wrists. “For every good story,” Greg said of love on
the Internet, “there are at least 100 bad stories—people
meeting and realizing there’s a major difference between
virtuality and reality.” A few months later, I decided, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>would check back in with Greg and Sue and report the results
at the end of “The Electronic Matchmaker.”</p>

<p class='c018'>For the moment I was optimistic. Greg and Sue had
been at this for a good two years; they spent several hours
a day pouring out their thoughts to each other, Greg at his
UNIX workstation, Sue at her lowly Packard Bell computer.
He had bought her a diamond ring on a layaway
plan; she was giving him a ring. She would fly Down
Under at some point, and then the next summer, Greg
would to go to Kansas City and meet Sue’s family, including
her father, a retired auto worker who, ah, had a few
surprises ahead.</p>

<p class='c018'>I think of good people like Greg and Sue when I read
the tacky, hacky stories about unhappy affairs online and
Net sex. While many politicians and reporters delve into
the sleazier areas of the Internet—and, yes, regions can
look like Silicon-era Sodoms—something wonderful is
also happening on the Net. It’s connecting lovers with uncannily
matched interests and values. Remember, the
Internet teems with more than 12,000 newsgroups. If
you’re quirky and picky, if you insist on a lover whose
hobby is Esperanto, the international language, try
soc.culture.esperanto. If you want to find a fellow Peace
Corps alumnus, you can choose from among several
newsgroups and lists. If you’re a Libertarian stalwart and
insist that your girlfriend be nothing but—well, the search
may take longer.</p>

<p class='c018'>Some philosophies just don’t hold out as much appeal
to women as do others. But that has not daunted a smart
young Libertarian in California, Eric Klien, who started
what may have been the Internet’s first matchmaking
service, an operation later taken over by Electric Classifieds.
Match.Com offers a long questionnaire that
should appeal to many of the detail-oriented habitués of
the Internet.</p>

<p class='c018'>Whatever your taste, the Net probably has a dating service
if that’s what you want. Operating with a French address
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>on the World Wide Web, Babb’s Personals shows up
with a photo of a green-eyed, dark-complected woman,
and a number of free, anonymous ads in French and
English. Christie’s Internet MatchMaker claims to reach
more than 14,000 users in seventeen cities. On the Net, too,
you’ll find HIV Positive Dating Services (“Meet other positives,
negatives, and neutrals locally, regionally, nationally,
and even globally”), Web Personals (“Now over 4,200 different
visitors each day!”), and Virtual MeetMarket (“I believe
that the people who browse through here, and more
importantly the people who bother to publish personals
here, are somewhat intelligent and Internet-savvy enough
to know the difference between FTP and FTD—you know,
the flower delivery guys?”).</p>

<p class='c018'>I found some of the catchiest ads on Virtual. One
showed a beautiful twenty-five-year-old brunette in Los
Angeles touching an empty set of casual clothes labeled
“Your picture here?” “I’m looking for somebody who’s
[<em>sic</em>] personality has a shelf life longer than a month,”
she said, and California spelling notwithstanding, she
clearly deserved just that sort of person. A graduate
student, hungering for a “sweet SWM of my dreams,”
inserted a picture of a knight in armor. Seeking “a
Scandinavian beauty,” a graphics designer from South
Carolina posted an almost magazine-quality layout with
photos of himself and his cats and even an aerial shot of
Charleston. The prose wasn’t the most imaginative, and
his Scandinavian requirement was rather limiting, but in
a flash the ad showed women what kind of life he could
offer them. Other possibilities exist on the Web. Instead of
just saying you like certain musicians or artists, for example,
you might write Web links to take people to an area
with sound or graphics files.</p>

<p class='c018'>The best matchmaker is the Internet itself, with all its
ways of bringing well-meaning people together. If Greg
married Sue, this would hardly be the first Australian-American
marriage born on the Net. Australia is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>e-mail capital of the universe, or at least the romantic regions
thereof. Until surpassed by the United Kingdom and
Canada, Australia had more Net connections than any
country except for the United States. Recently the Aussies’
telcom people started charging institutions for net connections
according to the amount of use, and that just
might crimp future Gregs and Sues. But at least in mid-1995,
Australia’s e-mail laurels remain unthreatened.</p>

<p class='c018'>American women love Australian men because they
speak the same language—more wittily than we Yanks do,
of course—and because they all carry huge knives with
which they can defend their girlfriends against crocodiles
and muggers. Isn’t that so, just as in the movies?
American men worship Australian women because we
know they are unappreciated down on the sheep ranch,
they’re literate, and have brilliant careers ahead of them.
Don’t knock stereotypes if they help bring the right people
together.</p>

<p class='c018'>The film <cite>Crocodile Dundee</cite> may or may not have been
on the mind of Laura Goodin when she was wandering
through soc.culture.australian. She saw “a message from
an Australian composer studying in the U.S.,” who told of
“an alternative tune to ‘Waltzing Matilda.’” Laura asked for
the music. Within months the Aussie proposed, right over
the Net in the same newsgroup. “Congratulatory messages
came from all over the United States, Australia, and New
Zealand.” Today Laura Goodin and Houston Dunleavy are
married and living together in the Washington, D.C., area,
with a baby on the way. They exchanged more than 1,500
messages during their courtship, not to mention countless
sessions of typing together in Teletype fashion, just as Greg
and Sue have done. It is not the same as talking the old-fashioned
way but can save enough in phone bills to pay
for an engagement ring or maybe a more powerful computer.
“A long-distance relationship is hellish,” Laura says,
“but the pain is eased somewhat by the Internet.”<a id='r7.1' /><a href='#f7.1' class='c022'><sup>[7.1]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>This isn’t just happening on the Internet itself. When a
New York City woman was testing a service that became
America Online, marriage was the last thing on her mind.
Nevertheless she ended up married in Virginia to a lover
she met via e-mail. Rush Limbaugh, the conservative radio
host, met his wife on CompuServe, where, supposedly, she
had sought his advice on coping with a liberal professor. A
chef and a substitute teacher met on Prodigy and flew off to
Las Vegas together, thinking they would enjoy the video
poker if nothing else; they won $4,000 and each other.<a id='r7.2' /><a href='#f7.2' class='c022'><sup>[7.2]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c018'>A psychiatrist has even written a novel about online
relationships, <cite>Virtual Love</cite>. “E-mail has been called the
singles bar of the 90’s,” Dr. Avodah Offit told the <cite>New York
Times</cite>. “And that concept intrigues me a lot. The traditional
ways that people meet now do not allow much access
to each other’s minds, and that has not led to
enduring relationships.” What’s the best place to find out
about your potential spouse? By sitting silently through
movies or boozing it up in noisy, smoky nightspots, or by
sharing intimacies over the modem? “I find people are
more open on e-mail,” she says. And I agree.</p>

<p class='c018'>The Internet, to be sure, is hardly a romantic nirvana,
and although this chapter will be positive about net romance
for the most part, I’ll mix the praise with some
lengthy warnings. Some sections of the Net will please
fundamentalist preachers no more than will the red-light
areas of New York or Calcutta. From alt.sex.bondage I
called up a digitized photo fit for the Marquis de Sade.
The caption accurately read, “Japanese girl tied to rack
while master pours hot wax on her breast. Looks very
painful and her face shows it.” Just about all of those
posting to the forum are male despite the heterosexual
orientation of the typical messages. This area of the Net is
about as woman friendly as <cite>Hustler</cite>. Offensively, too, the
Internet also comes with sections devoted to bestiality,
and, yes, discussion of adult-child sex. In every case, of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>course, society must distinguish between shared fantasies
and real acts. (As indicated in chapter 6, Exonian
laws aren’t the solution—parental vigilance and access-control
software are.)</p>

<p class='c018'>A more serious worry, from the viewpoint of women
hoping for romance on the Internet, is the locker-room attitudes
that can show up even in some respectable areas.
Consider the cause of this: the numbers.</p>

<p class='c018'>If you go by one network veteran, fewer than one in
twenty of the early Netfolks were female. By popular belief,
maybe a tenth of the people on the Net are female, a
far smaller percentage than on other services such as
Prodigy and America Online. The truth, however, is a bit
more complicated. John Quarterman and Smoot Carl-Mitchell
of Texas Internet Consulting, which regularly
tracks the demographics of the Net, reported in the May
1995 issue of their publication <cite>Matrix News</cite> that according
to a survey in October 1994, 64 percent of Netfolks
were male and 36 percent female. And among educational
institutions the percentage of females was as high
as 41 percent. Borders between the Internet and commercial
services are breaking down Berlin Wall fashion, so
you can expect the Internet to show an increasing
amount of female influence.</p>

<p class='c018'>The old stereotype, however, that the Net is male dominated,
would seem to hold up for the moment. Even the
virtual dating services tend to have far, far more men than
women despite, in some cases, better terms for female
customers.</p>

<p class='c018'>The reasons for the ratios are world famous. Computers
in the past were to girls what trucks and catchers’
mitts were also: the province of boys. Thousands of men
in the computer industry are still oblivious to the existence
of another sex. When I write popular-level computer
books, male editors often demand that I stick to the
technology rather than show how <em>people</em> use it. Most
women, however, recoil from the Internet and other high
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>tech unless they see practical reasons for bothering with
UNIX commands and similar horrors; they have been
raised to favor humans over gadgetry. Let’s hope that the
old fears vanish as more women befriend computers and
programs grow easier for both genders.</p>

<p class='c018'>Meanwhile, however, on some areas of the Internet,
women can be treated like females in Asian countries that
pamper baby boys but all too often let sickly girls die or
even kill the fetuses. A few men ignore female Netfolks except
for purposes of humiliation, sex, or combinations of
the two. Although messages from women tend to draw
more replies on the Net than those from males, the end results
can dismay; one man reportedly welcomed a woman
to a discussion group, launched a political dialogue, then
shifted in a nanosecond to a request for a swap of nude
pictures. Women tell of weirdoes stalking them via e-mail,
flooding their Net accounts with unwanted messages. One
victim, as reported in <cite>Mother Jones</cite> magazine, suffered
“an untraceable e-mail ‘bomb’ containing hundreds of
sexual and violent messages, the mildest of which was
‘Shut up bitch.‘”</p>

<p class='c018'>At the same time women on the Internet can enjoy
less of the sort of attention they desire. Some Netfolks
don’t pay as much attention to the public messages of
women, and besides, female Internauts may not want to
post anyway in some areas, given the outright insults and
sarcasm that may await them. Women seek harmony and
compromise; much of the Net thrives on controversy.</p>

<p class='c018'>My wife, who, like most of her gender on the Internet,
hates flame wars, has even run across a newsgroup
whose people venture forth to start arguments in other
groups. What is a hobby to some men can be an antisocial
practice to women. Many women hesitate to speak up on
the Net, whatever the topic under discussion. Disturbing
statistics come from Gladys We, a graduate student at
Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, Canada. Writing in
the magazine <cite>Virtual Culture</cite>, she says at least four-fifths
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>of several hundred postings to alt.feminism were by men.
She tallied figures almost as lopsided in soc.women. “Only
in soc.feminism,” We writes, “amid accusations of censorship,
were there comparable numbers of postings from
women and men.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Given the obstacles that women often face on the
Internet, then, it is amazing at times that <em>any</em> romances
happen there. When they do, yet another danger arises—the
risk of missed cues. A friendship online may cause either
sex to ignore mismatched words and gestures that
might put them on guard. One Los Angeles women met
her boyfriend on a BBS and suffered a disaster that could
just as well have happened by way of the Net. He got her
pregnant, begged her not to abort, married her, and made
life a real hell, not just a virtual one, until they divorced.</p>

<p class='c018'>Worrisome, too, are the eternal tensions that go on in
cyberspace between sincere Befrienders and not-so-sincere
Gamesplayers, who the former have trouble detecting.
The Befrienders seek friends and lovers; the
Gamesplayers would just as soon toy with a human as
hack a program. An argument might even be made that
high tech attracts more than its share of people who thrive
on impermanence. You do not last long in computers if
you believe that Pentium-level chips are forever, or that
28.8K-bps modems are more than throwaway technology
in the general scheme of things. Faster chips, higher
speed modems, and new girlfriends or boyfriends are
sure to come along. That’s the mind-set. Let’s just hope
that the girlfriends and boyfriends will last.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I am burning with a need to talk with you, to share
with you my fears, my joys,” one Australian women cooed
via modem to a man in the Canadian province of Alberta.
Within two weeks her ardor did not just cool, it inexplicably
froze. “This is the very last time I will write to you,”
she said. Very possibly—we can’t say for sure without
ESP—the Australian woman was a Gamesplayer.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>Gamesplayers enjoy at least one big advantage on the
Internet. They can post their electronic want ads through
computers, known as anonymous servers, that strip their
names and other compromising identifiers.<a id='r7.3' /><a href='#f7.3' class='c022'><sup>[7.3]</sup></a> And replies
can come through anonymous servers. The same technology
used to protect privacy can let Gamesplayers fool victim
after victim, and even mask genders. Particularly in
fantasy games on the Net you can never be sure if you’re
typing to a woman or a man who just wants more attention—abusive
or not. What’s more, for the skillful there
are ways to forge messages to unsuspecting neophytes.</p>

<p class='c018'>Another negative is that the Net can be as helpful to
adulterers as to the moral and sincere. A techie has just
poured out to me a story of the kind that Carson
McCullers would have written if she had fixated on the
Internet rather than on the American South. His wife, the
mother of two children, has been using the Net to cheat on
him in a massive way. She befriended two alcoholics by
way of her modem, the marriage counselor says he has
done all he could, and now comes word that she just
might have the AIDS virus; I hear it’s too early for a conclusive
HIV test.</p>

<p class='c018'>If sexual excitement is the only goal of <em>certain</em>
Netfolks, and if the crowd in alt.sex.wanted is too creepy,
some professional women just might meet their needs. As
noted earlier in this book, a little outfit called Brandy’s
Babes advertised on the World Wide Web—complete with
hints of more than just visual stimuli. The babes are apparently
off the Net now, but some would say that successors
are inevitable. In <em>limited</em> ways the Net and the world
of professional sex are much alike: both have their jargon
and, for those who seek it, their anonymity.</p>

<p class='c018'>Both worlds are rich in eccentrics. For example, I recently
ran across a woman in her late forties who was
about to bear a baby with a computer scientist she met on
the Net “an hour before April Fool’s Day.” She says the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>child was accidentally “conceived about two weeks after
meeting ‘in the flesh.’ We are having the baby first. <em>Then</em>
we will talk about marriage on a serious basis. I’m delighted
at the prospect of being a mum at last, and I am
not your average clunky woman at all. I generally feel
much better about myself. I introduced Tom to sex, and he
says he had no idea how cuddle-deprived he was. He’s
now quite addicted to me.” Tom and his computer are
now part of her household; like many Netfolks he can use
his modem to work virtually anywhere, which in some
cases is yet another advantage of online romance.</p>

<p class='c018'>Like most denizens of the Internet, the e-mail lovers
just mentioned are well educated. And, although the
woman was between jobs, Netfolks are normally at least
affluent. If they are students, their parents are middle
class or better. While the price of Internet service is coming
down, and while access is free in some cities and at
many American colleges, the Net doesn’t exactly teem
with welfare mothers.</p>

<p class='c018'>So what other patterns emerge among lovers who
meet through the Net? “I haven’t done a study of the personality
curve, the introvert-extrovert ratio,” Avodah Offit,
the psychiatrist who wrote <cite>Virtual Love</cite>, told me, “but my
experience is just the opposite of what one might expect
My ‘high user’ contacts are all very sociable types who
hate being out of contact with others at any time of day or
night. Of course my correspondents are not generally engaged
in romance with me, but they do write to others online
in a variety of relationships.” My own observations
suggest that while many net.lovers may be introverts, her
thoughts would hold true.</p>

<p class='c018'>Judging from lovers whose photos I’ve seen, the
plugged-in couples are neither more nor less attractive
than the world at large. But the plainer ones can use prose
to compensate for looks; this is a medium where words
are everything.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>I hope that the people’s love letters don’t just vanish,
because the output of <em>some</em> Netfolks can be charmingly
Victorian in style, feeling, or sheer volume. “My family
took it pretty hard at first and were a bit skeptical, especially
my Mum,” says an Australian college student who
fell in love with an American more than a decade older
than she is, ”but then I gave them some of the early letters
to read, a pile of 100, the only ones I had time to print out,
and the next day my mother came up to me and said, ‘I am
very happy for you. I am glad you have Frank.’ I was waiting
for the ‘But,’ but it never came.” A New England
woman, who married a fellow clarinet player she met on
the Internet, says he once showed her a $1,000-plus telephone
bill. That’s Love, capital L. Maybe the nineteenth
century is alive in some quarters, whatever the medium,
voice or e-mail.</p>

<p class='c018'>Below I’ll tell stories of Greg and Sue; a bachelor who
was looking for a woman who wouldn’t treat him like “a
peripheral”; and a man who, to his distress, found himself
cuckolded more easily because his wife was on the Net.</p>

<div class='textbox1 width25'>

<p class='c018'>Greg and Sue</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>Adelaide was where Greg Smith majored in library
studies at the University of South Australia. It was a graceful
port and state capital with a Mediterranean climate, a
population of a million, the Torrens River in the center,
and swarms of college students from three schools.
Named for Queen Adelaide, the wife of England’s King
William IV, the city dated back to the 1830s. Kangaroos
still hopped around in the countryside, but Adelaide itself
was both urban and urbane. It was full of churches and
bars alike, along with trendy shops in Rundle Mall and
elsewhere. The State Theater put on Shakespearean plays
at an internationally known festival center.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>Not surprisingly, Adelaide has been described as the
Boston of South Australia. While some young locals may
shrug off the place as too churchy and sleepy, others might
disagree. Adelaide in many ways is a young person’s
town—a good place to meet the opposite sex. Greg Smith,
in fact, did find women in the corporeal world around him,
but the relationships never took root, and in the early
1990s he was still on the lookout in the bars (“universities
are great for this”), the parks, the buses, the mall—you
name it. He had his attractions. Greg, in fact, was on the
handsome side, if you went by the digitized photo and
other information conveyed over the Net. He stood six-foot
four, weighed around 190, kept in shape by walking, and
had thick, dark brown hair, and a winsome smile.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I’m a physical person,” Greg told me. “I like to be
with people. I like ‘reading’ people for body language and
all that.” From the very start he was aware of the perils
and limitations of the Internet in such areas as love. You
had to trust the words of strangers, not sharing their own
reality. “Relationships are established where one party is
totally sincere and all that, and the other one is just getting
a laugh out of it.” Just the same, he could not resist touring
the Internet and the bulletin board to which his international
connections led.</p>

<p class='c018'>Young people like Greg Smith, who sought out new
places on the Net, whether bulletin boards or electronic libraries,
were vaguely like the Jack Kerouacs <a id='corr302.27'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='of 50s’'>of the ’50s</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_302.27'><ins class='correction' title='of 50s’'>of the ’50s</ins></a></span> who
liked bumming around the United States for its own sake.
Some would describe the high-tech Kerouacs as “net
surfers.” But the phrase “net surfing” has become so trivialized
in the media that perhaps we should return to the
Kerouac analogy.<a id='r7.4' /><a href='#f7.4' class='c022'><sup>[7.4]</sup></a> <em>Kerouing</em>, not surfing. Stark differences,
of course, existed between the international Internet and
the American towns of <cite>On the Road</cite>, the famous Kerouac
novel. Greg had spent some time in the United States
when he was ten years old and loved to keep up with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>American sports, but he was very much a creature of
Australia, with a distinctly Aussie flavor in his accent and
values. Nor was he a rebel in the true Kerouac tradition.
You could be a library science major and still soak up the
culture of the Net; you didn’t have to hop on and off freight
trains and risk poverty or a severed leg.</p>

<p class='c018'>In fact, while hooked into an established institution
such as a corporation or a university, you just might do
better than if you had to buy all the gadgetry yourself—just
so you didn’t flunk out while you were partaking. A
<em>teacher</em> might even encourage your wanderings. And that
was how Greg ended up on the Net for the first time in
1992. He found himself logging onto electronic bulletin
boards all over the planet, with bizarre names such as
“Badboy’s Better BBS System” or “Chatsubo.” He was at
least partly drawn to such places because they were so
much like neighborhoods or small towns. Each came
with its own set of friendships, love affairs, and feuds that
could reach an intensity even greater than those on the
discussion areas of the main Net.</p>

<p class='c018'>The woman who married Rush Limbaugh is said to
have exchanged tart words with Limbaugh on CompuServe
at the start of their relationship, and the same happened
with Greg and Sue. They did not attempt an
alt.personals-style romance. Via Chatsubo he and she were
just patterns of dots on each other’s cathode ray tubes. In
fact, the two even butted heads over the question of
whether certain people were abusing computer resources.</p>

<p class='c018'>Sue, it should be noted, was not a true technophile;
she could fire up a modem and use easy UNIX commands
and that was about it. Even so, the two shared much else.
Greg was around twenty at the time, just a year or so older
than she was. Sue was a college student, at Northwestern
Missouri State University. “I like her intensity, her sarcastic
wit, her humor, and her, I dunno, just her way of seeing
things,” Greg would say of the Sue he came to know.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>“Politically we’re very similar, as regards political policy
and all that. Our tastes in music are close. Our pleasures
are drawn from simple, similar things. For example, we
are both mad about long walks, NFL football, curling up
in front of fires, walking in the mall, playing in the rain,
and on and on it goes.” Sue had been thinking about
teaching, among other possible careers (political work
and diplomacy happened to be others), and she enjoyed
museums. Greg’s father had taught Shakespeare once,
and his mother had also been a teacher. So while nothing
Oedipal was at work here, Greg might well be more comfortable
with a woman who shared familiar priorities.</p>

<p class='c018'>Just as important, both Greg and Sue could breeze
along on a keyboard and say <em>plenty</em> online. In the near future,
people might be able to speak into a microphone
with those at the other end seeing words pop up on the
screen, but for the moment the Net was friendliest to good
typists, especially those who could write well, as Greg and
Sue could. They could almost be playwrights, the way
they loved stage directions such as “Hugs” and “Wave
good-byes.” If a feeling occurred to either, they could
transfer it from their brain cells to the keyboard and make
the recipient <em>see</em> their thoughts. When Sue sent a letter to
Greg and me, it was obvious she wanted to get back to her
private correspondence with him. She ended her note:
“*hugs greg* hold your horses sweetie, I’m typing as fast
as I can :-).” I could see that techie or not, Sue felt at home
at the computer keyboard.</p>

<p class='c018'>Without trying to woo each other across fourteen time
zones, the two friends grew closer as they made the rounds
of the BBSs on the Net. One of the boards carried a gallery
of digitized photos, and Greg enjoyed Sue’s face. The look
was American-Midwestern. Her light blonde hair flowed
in a way that must have pleased him.<a id='r7.5' /><a href='#f7.5' class='c022'><sup>[7.5]</sup></a> She had green eyes
broken up with what she has described as a “strange
shade of yellow.” The skin was pale, the Scandinavian in
her. In one of the shots she posed with a knee resting on a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>well-padded armchair. She wore a crocheted sweater,
pants, and flats, and looked sexy but in a fresh, friendly
way that would not have threatened a schoolteacher’s son.
Greg, in turn, pleased Sue; in fact, even more so later on
when she learned of his height; she herself stood five-feet
ten and favored tall men.</p>

<p class='c018'>Sue especially relished his sense of humor. “I could
log in after a totally crappy day in classes and I’d have
some corny e-mail from Greg that would send a smile to
my face no matter what I felt like. He was, still is, and
probably will be, the only person who can really cheer me
up no matter what the circumstances are.” Love, however,
just wasn’t on the minds of Greg and Sue in those early
days. She had family and friends in Kansas City and
counted on braving the frigid Missouri winters while she
went to college. Meanwhile she had experienced her
share of romances off the Net, including one with a shy
friend who helped introduce her to the online world by
suggesting that they <em>type</em> to each other. Sue may or may
not have been ready for yet another relationship.</p>

<p class='c018'>Even if she and Greg were just friends, they were
paving the way for something more by slowly trading secrets
about themselves. Lois Shawver, a California psychologist
often online, warned me of the lack of trust that
can afflict many long-distance relationships via computer.
And yet paradoxically, the Net could bring people
closer to each other. “It’s so easy to end a relationship,”
Shawver told me, “you simply stop corresponding.” So
“people seem to be more willing to take a chance and disclose
intimately. That helps to create trust. I do think that
also explains the medium’s ability to help people bridge
cultural gaps.” It was all certainly true in the case of Sue
and Greg.</p>

<p class='c018'>Helpful, too, was the emphasis that they placed on the
platonic at the start, without even meaning to do so. Is it just
possible that horny young men and women on the Internet
and elsewhere could declare a one-year moratorium on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>raunchier forms of “cybersex” where men and women exchanged
lewd remarks with each other, Teletype fashion,
in group settings? Ditto for the online world’s many homosexuals
and bisexuals. Ironically the aftermath might be
<em>more</em> sex and better sex after some true friendships developed
by way of electronic mail and one-to-one chats. One
test of friendship, of course, might be this: Would a couple
still write to each other if their Net connection ended? And
Sue and Greg had passed so far: Her Internet account had
vanished after she left Northwestern Missouri State University
to work and go to school part-time. She ended up at
an insurance company. Letters written on pulped trees,
comic strips, editorial cartoons, music cassettes, material of
all kinds, had traveled between Australia and Missouri. “We
got closer and closer with each postage stamp,” Sue told
me, “and believe me, there were a bunch. The post office
likes me a <em>lot</em>.” Finally, however, Sue had returned to the
Net, this time with a private account</p>

<p class='c018'>On August 7, 1994, she had to break off an online chat
to leave for work. “And I had one more question for her,”
Greg recalled. “She asked what it was. And I asked her
plain and simple, ‘Will you marry me?’ There was a pause
of about thirty seconds, and she asked me if I was serious.
I said, ‘Yes, never more so,’ and she said ‘Yes.’” Sue let her
mother and a sister in on what was happening. She told
certain friends, too, but not her brother and father. “It’s
just going to be incomprehensible to them,” Greg told me,
“that this could happen over a chunk of cable. Add to that
I’m stealing away their last child, not just out of the home,
or the state, but out of the country, and I can understand
why her father is not going to understand.”</p>

<p class='c018'>The same shocks would presumably await Greg’s
mum and dad. “I think it’s more the medium than anything
else. It’s way new to them, but for me it’s just part of
the way we do things now. *Grin*. Mum’s department just
got Lotus’ cc:Mail,<a id='r7.6' /><a href='#f7.6' class='c022'><sup>[7.6]</sup></a> and she was telling me about it and I
was like ‘Yeah, so?’ but she was really excited about it.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>Although Greg did talk to Sue from home, not just his university,
he could do so without his parents knowing, because
of the late hours he keeps, and because he lived in a
converted shed out back of his house. I pondered the
ironies here. Suddenly the Internet held out a new peril
for parents. Having fretted about electronic pornography,
Mom and Dad could now worry about children with more
noble but equally secret activities. Parents might erase
porno from a hard drive; it was not so easy to wipe out
love as sincere and intense as Greg and Sue’s.</p>

<p class='c018'>But had the two actually <em>talked</em>, telephone style, over
a real phone? “We’ve had a grand total of one phone call,”
Greg told me. Sue dialed him up. He said she’d kept
putting it off because she was scared. “I know, I know,”
he wrote, “we should talk more but I’m just a poor student.”
Greg inserted the computer symbol for a smile to
show he was kidding. “The one thing that surprised me
about that call was how naturally the conversation
flowed. I think it came from the fact that we are friends
first and a couple second—that the pressure of the relationship
was negated by the fact that we are such good
friends. I seem to recall impressions more than anything
else, like the lilt of her laugh, the timbre of her voice, the
accent. We just talked about stuff—us, love, Clinton’s
screwups in Congress, sports, everything. Very tough to
put the phone down.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Still,” I asked Sue by telephone, “won’t it be quite a
transition from the American Midwest to Australia?”</p>

<p class='c018'>In a friendly, steady voice she told how she had overcome
her hesitations. When Sue toured the local museums
now, she saw graffiti on statues, and she said the neighborhoods
were slipping. I thought of my grandmother’s old
place in Kansas City years ago, how it had been block-busted
by sleazes who frightened the whites away and
resold the houses at handsome profits to Afro-Americans.
Hotrods had roared up and down Chestnut Street;
Grandma had been the last white holdout. The memory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>still enraged me. Although I hadn’t been to Kansas City in
years, I believed Sue.</p>

<p class='c018'>“My brother and sister are quite a bit older than I
am,” she went on, ”and they both have children of their
own, and I’m not crazy about the idea of leaving them to
know their aunt through phone calls and video tapes. But
I have no intention of staying in the Midwest just for my
family’s sake.</p>

<p class='c018'>“It’s my life and what I want to do requires more than
the Midwest has to offer. I can fit in well wherever I go.
And I’ve gotten a few books on Oz. From what I’ve read,
I’ll like Australia just as long as I don’t have to wear one of
those damn hats and worship Paul Hogan. I have Greg to
worship. They may drive on the wrong side of the road
and drink beer with lunch, but it’s not like I’ll have to
learn a whole new language.” Besides, she loved the idea
of the children growing up with an accent as delightful as
the one she heard from Greg.</p>

<p class='c018'>I asked Greg if his virtual romance with Sue had
changed him. “It’s relieved a lot of the pressure that exists
between myself and women, because it’s no longer that
I’m looking for something more than friendship—I have a
relationship which satisfies those needs and so don’t need
anything from those friendships. What is most interesting
is that change that I haven’t picked up but that other
women must have. In the two-and-a-half years I’ve been at
the university, I’ve been ‘hit on’ a grand total of zero times
that I can remember. In the twenty days or so that I’ve
been engaged, I’ve been hit on three times. And for the life
of me, I can’t figure out exactly what is making women
see me as attractive. And they weren’t friends or acquaintances
either—completely unknown to me. Weird.”</p>

<p class='c018'>So how much had Greg changed Sue? “A lot,” she
e-mailed back. Sue said: “Being with Greg has taught me,
if anything else, that my life doesn’t have any boundaries,
be they physical or emotional or geographic.” This was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>more than lover’s mush; I noticed her use of “With Greg,”
as if they were in the same room.</p>

<p class='c018'>Asked for love letters—no pressure, let me emphasize—the
two obliged with thousands of words just from
their August 1994 writings alone. Mostly the letters were
from Sue whose feelings were more conveniently preserved
in digital form than were the letters from Greg. He
wasn’t holding back: He was the one who had contacted
me about their romance. What followed from Sue was
more affecting than anything I’d read in a novel, for it was
real, and I learned about it in the same way that Greg did,
through a series of pixels on a computer screen. Reading
this one message would help explain why she was willing
to leave Kansas City; why she felt that, regardless of a father
with heart trouble, she had felt free to move on; perhaps
even why she was willing to share her life so openly
with me through this book, for a chronicle was an affirmation
of sorts.</p>

<p class='c018'>New to me but old to Greg, the revelation did not come
immediately. Sue’s August letters started out mainly with
the routine, the glue of long-range relationships, the confirmation
that she wanted Greg to know her life and likes.
There was talk of food (“I love you more than I love
munching on peanut butter and crackers”), diets (“I
splurged on Chinese and probably regained the three
pounds I lost”), art (at the Nelson museum she favored the
impressionists), friends’ babies (“Barbara went to the doctor
this morning to check and see how the baby was
doing—she was about ten weeks along, and she had a
miscarriage”), school (Sue was attending community college
and could not resist sharing a few unabashedly corny
jokes about her anatomy course), places to go on vacation
(“Hey,” she said, in a discussion of Mount Rushmore, “do
you Aussies get weird and chisel the faces of dead leaders
onto mountainsides, or is that a distinctly American thing
to do?”), and jobs (“this working full time and college at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>night is starting to wear me down a bit, but for the time
being it’s what I want to do”).</p>

<p class='c018'>Like almost any woman she <em>planned</em>. The word was
that Greg should wrap some paper around his fingers and
snip it off at the right place and send the results on to her
so she’d know the size of his ring. And should it be silver
or gold? They discussed pajamas. “I always thought it
would be cool to share a pair of PJs with someone,” Sue
wrote. “I’d wear the tops, you’d get the bottom. Okay, so
I’m cheesy, but I guess it’s the American upbringing :).
Shrug.” In her mind Sue saw the “really cool chapel in
Rapid City, South Dakota, where my grandparents on
dad’s side renewed their vows for their fiftieth wedding
<a id='corr310.14'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='anniversary.'>anniversary.”</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_310.14'><ins class='correction' title='anniversary.'>anniversary.”</ins></a></span> “I wanna get married in it,” she wrote Greg.
“There’s a place where you can light a candle for a loved
one and say a prayer to keep them safe. Well, I lit a candle
for Barbara, and then I lit one for us. It felt weird to be in a
church for a good reason. Seems that all the last ones have
been for funerals.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Another close friend had died some time back, and
she reflected on the connection between that and a period
of heavy activity on the bulletin board circuit. “When I
logged on, I could just be some faceless person—no one
had to know that my best friend was in the hospital room
semicomatose because he had developed full-blown
AIDS. There were so many people in my life that just up
and left because Ralph* got sick; it was almost as if I had
AIDS just by association. So I got online and became
everyone’s favorite sweetheart.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Then a signal fact emerged in the correspondence,
something that explained who Sue was, and why Sue felt
like Sue, although I believed that she and Greg would
have wanted to be together even if her circumstances had
been different. “I had just found out,” she told him, “that I
had won a fight against a terminal illness while Ralph
was losing his. I don’t talk about the fact that I am a cancer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>survivor very much, because I haven’t been in remission
that long. It will be two years in September.</p>

<p class='c018'>“All I want to do is make it to the five-year mark and
forget the pain and the tears and the chemo and the treatments,”
the letter said. “I want to look forward and be able
to see a future without constant trips to the hospital, to
days and nights when I can just be healthy and happy. I
have a tendency to block out when I was sick because if I
don’t think about it, I don’t remember it, and if I don’t remember
it, I don’t worry about it coming back. If you ask,
I will tell you everything.” Very early on in their friendship,
Greg had known that the cancer was cervical; any
children would have to be adopted. Sue ended the message
by assuring him that she no longer wanted “the foreign
policy degree from Georgetown anymore, or the
chance to have the President asking my opinion on
things.” Her goal now was Greg, an affordable flat, and a
roomful of kids to teach.</p>

<p class='c018'>The rest of her letters went on to discuss such cosmic
questions as Sue’s love of long showers in the mornings,
her tendency to roll around a little in her sleep, and Greg’s
hatred of his cataloguing duties.<a id='r7.7' /><a href='#f7.7' class='c022'><sup>[7.7]</sup></a> “I love love love love love
you,” he wrote, and heated up the wires some more while
he and Sue dreamed of hugs at the airport, unstoppable
passion, and a wedding.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Know,” he told her, “that there’s a goofy, tall, dark,
Australian, madly-in-love man here dreaming of you, and
us, and the future.” I was betting right now that they’d
make it to that South Dakota church.</p>

<div class='textbox1 width45'>

<p class='c018'>Lee Chen: The Lover as a Peripheral</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>He was a hacker, a true denizen of the Internet, and a
poet at times. A word in one poem told all: “peripheral.” It
means a printer, a modem, a scanner, or any other gadget
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>that plugs into the main computer, yet is not one of the <em>very</em>
most important parts. And that’s how some women on the
Net saw him, the human equivalent of a printer, someone
on the peripheries of their minds. He was among their
friends but not their lovers. His own love went unreturned.
So he called his poem “Song of a Peripheral”; he posted it
to alt.romance, soc.couples, alt.support.loneliness, and
alt.support.shyness. It read, in part:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c036'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>You feel you’re nothing special in her life.</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>You never get a sense that she wants you to be close to her.</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>You’re just a pleasant, polite friend around the periphery of her world.</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>But you still care for her, because she is that special woman—</em></div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>A sweetest heart who cares for the well-being of others.</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>A most sensuous soul who is full of life and passion.</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>And a beautiful intellect who brings realist precepts to balance out those disillusions in the world.</em></div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><em>... It’s painful to feel you’re just a Peripheral, isn’t it?</em></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c024'>“How could I <em>not</em> print part of ‘Song’ in this chapter,” I
thought, and wrote Lee Chen for permission. Back came a
letter from the Department of Computer Science at the
University of Calgary in Canada. People on the Internet love
to end messages with “signatures” telling how they see the
cosmos, and Lee had picked a quote that looked as gentle
and logical as his poem. The speaker was the President of
the United States in the movie <cite>Dr. Strangelove or How I
Learned to Start Worrying and Love the Bomb</cite>. And the
words went, “You can’t fight in here, this is the War Room.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Sometimes I thought that in the battle of the sexes, certain
areas of the Internet could be that war room. No man
could claim to be a superhunk or millionaire without risking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>a female retort in the vein of, “Yeah, sure.” The Net was
rich with put-downs worthy of an old Tracy-Hepburn
movie. Clearly the men had started this war, however.
“When a female shows up,” said the author of an explanatory
file on alt.sex.wanted, “clueless folks tend to e-mail
‘wanna fuck’ messages no matter <em>what</em> she has said. This
means many of them don’t post, only listen.” Fights had
also broken out between the gays and certain heterosexuals,
who came up with the witless fag jokes, and who, in
turn, had drawn equally stupid remarks about “breeders.”
In this sexual war, the biggest losers were SMHGs. That
was Netspeak for Straight Male Horny Geeks, who, as
noted earlier, suffered from the laws of supply and (lack
of) demand.</p>

<p class='c018'>Lee Chen was an SMHG in a nice way. His style had
been to try in alt.personals rather than one of the tackier
areas. When Lee had placed a recent ad, he had described
himself as “a romantic dreamer,” and he wanted “a single
woman between the ages of nineteen and thirty-three
who is sincere, intelligent, attractive,” and “passionate” as
well. Lee was twenty-six and entitled to feel his age.
Moreover, based on his self-description, women would
have no more reason to run away from him than they did
from Greg Smith in <em>his</em> lonely days.</p>

<p class='c018'>“I’m five feet eleven inches, 185 pounds, have dark
brown eyes and short black hair,” Lee said. “And I’m a
healthy, disease-free nonsmoker and considered attractive
looking.” He told me he held a master’s in computer science,
was continuing his studies, and obviously was destined
to earn a comfortable living at the very least. Lee
enjoyed “going out to movies and romantic dinners, discussing
current events and politics, visiting museums and
natural parks, walking along the rivers, listening to various
kinds of music, giving and receiving pleasures with a
sensuous partner.” So far, however, Lee lacked a woman—he
was new in town. Maybe a minor part of his problem, at
least among females off campus, was the kind of place that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>Calgary was. He saw it as “a cowboy city, big in the oil
business, very similar to Dallas culturally, except for the
cold winter climate.” This particular SMHG might have
felt more comfortable in a more intellectually minded city
such as Boston or San Francisco. But he was no snob and
still held out hope of meeting one of the locals rather than
confining the search to university people (“I’m sure there
are many wonderful women in this town”). Simultaneously
he decided to try the Net.</p>

<p class='c018'>The first time out with a personal ad, Lee heard from
a woman in, yes, Australia—E-Mail Central. Dozens of
love letters threatened to melt down any fiber-optics on
the Net; in fact, she sent Lee her erotic poetry and encouraged
him to reply with the same. Through it all, he was
high minded. “I believe in the mutual respect between
women and men,” he said, “but am also saddened by the
gradual decline of romantic chivalry in our society. I feel
they don’t need to be mutually exclusive.” His poet in
Australia seemed to feel the same. Within a month she
promised to fly to Canada.</p>

<p class='c018'>“My darkest knight, my love,” she called him. She
was “burning with a need to talk with you, to share with
you my fears, my joys. I ache to be able to brush a falling
raindrop from your cheek and hold your handsome face
close to my heart. I miss you already though we have
not met.”</p>

<p class='c018'>This woman could have been crafting bodice-rippers
for Harlequin Books. “I thrive on every word that falls
from your sensuous lips,” she wrote Lee. “I feel I am being
too bold for a lady of my breeding, but what I feel has
gone from my control before I was aware of my feelings.”
More letters followed, more fire, more steam. And then,
out of nowhere: “This is the very last time I will write to
you. You have to leave me alone. Any future mail you send
me will remain unanswered. We do not know each other.
Words across a net aren’t a firm basis of a relationship
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>and it takes time to form a friendship. We have neither
and I cannot currently give either to you. I have strong
personal commitments at the moment that leave me unable
to commit to anyone, especially a man in a romantic
way. Please understand. It may have been special and
beautiful, but it has to be over. One day I may be in a position
to explain further, but currently I cannot. I apologise
once more and wish you well in your life.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Maybe,” Lee looked back, “it was just a game for
her.” And, no dummy, he had learned from such experiences.
Nowadays Lee was wary of anonymous addresses
with low numbers that suggested their owners had been
cruising alt.personal for a long time.</p>

<p class='c018'>He had also learned of the usefulness of friendship as
a prelude to love. “Of all those ladies who answered my
original personal,” he said, “only one is still corresponding
as a friend.” Another female friend was also in his life
online, somebody he met in an unrelated newsgroup. She
typed out an popular opinion and he wrote in to agree,
and they found they shared interests. But neither saw romance
immediately ahead. Nor was that true of the other
friendships he had online. Although vague about them, he
suggested that he was still on the periphery.</p>

<p class='c018'>Reached some months later, Lee told me he had gone
on to befriend “quite a few nice women around this campus.”
In person and on the Net, however, he had yet to
meet just the right one for those river walks, museum
tours, and “giving and receiving pleasure.”</p>

<p class='c018'>“Well, sorry, David,” Lee said, “but I didn’t have a
happy ending. <a id='corr315.30'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='“I‘m sure'>I‘m sure</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_315.30'><ins class='correction' title='“I‘m sure'>I‘m sure</ins></a></span> there are some people who actually
find their true loves this way. Although I didn’t find
true love, I’ve found many sincere friendships via the Net.
So I’m glad that the Net has worked for me.” I was, too,
and I wished him all kinds of wonderful surprises ahead.
Chivalrous SMHGs like Lee Chen should be more than
peripherals.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span></div>
<div class='textbox1 width25'>

<p class='c018'>Net Adultery</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>Places like New York or Tokyo abound with museums,
art galleries, movie houses, universities, and large pools
of single people who hope to meet the same. Something
else, however, awaits those looking for it—more opportunities
for adultery than in small towns. And it is the same
with the Internet. It isn’t just that straying wives and husbands
can use those identity-stripping computers in
Finland to make swap shopping easier. More importantly,
the Internet teems with bright, funny, people who hate
convention, including, in some cases, marriage.</p>

<p class='c018'>For a stretch, a support-style mailing list came across
as a Peyton Place in cyberspace. A man and a woman met
there. He told her he would be leaving his wife and children.
She spent that weekend with a <em>third</em> member of the
list; after the original man publicly confessed, she popped
up out of the blue to give her side. If anyone doubted that
computers could bring people together in person, this was
proof positive in the worst way. Most members of the list
were horrified. They pleaded for Peyton Placers to go offline.
Clearly the Internet does not turn people into
saints—it just makes it easier to do what comes naturally,
good or bad.</p>

<p class='c018'>But some context, please. The same Net could bring together
old-fashioned romantics. As shown by the Smith-Olson
pairing, the Net could actually <em>strengthen</em> traditional
values among those who so inclined.</p>

<p class='c018'>Besides, much of the illicit action on the Net was by
the mutual consent of husbands and wives. When I ventured
into a seamy area called alt.personals.poly, I saw an
ad posted by a swinging couple from Florida. “I am 6′3″
brown haired, considered attractive,” said Hank*, the husband.
“She is 5ʹ0″ busty, blonde, blue eyes, very pretty.
We’re not weird or disturbed or wanting to beat people,
hahaha. We are very sensual, passionate, and are good at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>ya know the fun stuff.” Was this the ’Bahn that Bill and Al
had in mind for us? Not quite. But it wasn’t as if some pervert
was cheating on his wife and hiding behind an
anonymous server while lusting for a nineteen-year-old
coed who was new to both life and the Net. Although I did
not condone Hank’s swinging, I actually felt a little sorry
for him after he wrote me a short but touching letter: He
told how a woman had stood him up and the Missus.
Better luck next time, Hank.</p>

<p class='c018'>Suppose, however, that a man and woman had been
married for fifteen years and had two children, he was a
straight-arrow programmer type, she was funny and sexy,
he introduced her to the Internet, and she got crushes on
men whom she befriended over the wire—a marriage just
might fall apart because a stranger might actually fly in
from out of town wanting to get to know her in a biblical
way. Such was the case of Phil* and Jayne*. While I have
scrambled the details of the story, it is entirely true in
spirit. They lived in Cincinnati, and Bill worked as a programmer
and an Internet administrator for his employer.
He had arranged for his wife to be able to dial up the office
computer from home and send and receive e-mail. That,
as we’ll learn in a moment, was a key fact.</p>

<p class='c018'>In many ways Phil and Jayne were a contrast. He
could “readily repair my hurt emotions when it comes to
betrayal, be it from friends, or from my wife.” Phil held
himself to the highest of standards no matter how low-minded
the rest of the cosmos was. Jayne, on the other
hand, was wild and loved to party and speak up. “She can
drink anyone under the table,” Phil said. “She has a loud
voice and a happy disposition. She can talk to anyone and
make them feel at ease. She is a joy to be with. A blonde
with striking blue eyes. She has the attitude of a redhead
but we never fight. She rarely sports a smile, but when she
does, it is radiant. She has an excellent body, but she
keeps on thinking it is not quite desirable. She has gone in
for plastic surgery because of her low self-esteem.”</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>For some years in her life, Jayne suffered from another
problem—stodginess, of all things. Taxiing children
around, nagging them to do their schoolwork, playing the
good mother, had made her too conservative. Phil wanted
the old sparks back. So he introduced her to “an e-mail
friend of mine who had been a catalyst for many parties
as well. I hoped this would spur her into action.” It did.
She began a love affair over the Net. “I often ran to the
computer room after getting home from work to find
Jayne engrossed in some letter writing. She would immediately
cover the screen and ask me to leave. I could see
the discomfort in her face. This was one of my clues to ask
around and to check up on what might be happening. I
caught them in the act in a swank hotel.” For the sake of
the children, however, Phil forgave her and did not divorce.
He even revived his friendship with his e-mail
friend.</p>

<p class='c018'>A second man, however, cuckolded Phil a few years
later, and like the first, he was an alcoholic. “He would
hound her,” Phil said, “and send copious amounts of e-mail,
call her from wherever he was regardless of how
distant. He had an attitude that ‘no one can tell him what
to do, even if it is an affair.’” So Phil, despite his forgiving
nature, did what many red-blooded men would have done
in his place as a local Internet administrator. He deleted
their electronic mail from the office system. “The second
affair rekindled after the lover’s wife left him,” Phil says.
Lawyers successfully pried Jayne and the man apart.</p>

<p class='c018'>“She has ‘fallen’ into love with other people on the
Net,” Phil said, however, “and some have even taken the
trouble to fly in to meet her.” Fortunately the moon and the
stars and the hormones weren’t right. So where on the Net
did Jayne hook up with these winners? Alt.sex.wanted? No,
Phil said—rec.humor. And he actually feared rec.humor
more than he did the plain, sex-oriented areas of the Net,
because it might pave the way for a relationship based on
more than carnal impulses.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>I asked, “As a local Net administrator, do you think
that people on the Net play around more or less than does
the general population?”</p>

<p class='c018'>“About the same,” Phil said. “But there are a lot more
insecure personalities acting out an alternate personality
on the net. This will often lead, I think, to more misunderstandings.
Someone can appear to love you a lot, over e-mail,
but cannot carry through in person.” And then Phil
came up with another fascinating insight, which could
also apply to some relationships on the Internet between
single people. He observed that certain Netfolks really
didn’t care that much about the men or women at the
other end. Rather they used electronic mail as a diary.
“Jayne cherished the e-mail she got from one of her
lovers,” Phil said, “but in person he is a lying, cheating,
and abusive drunk with a far more shallow agenda.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Phil and Jayne were doing what they could to repair
the damage. The two had undergone marriage counseling.
“Stop trying to think so much,” Phil was told. “This
makes you appear to be walking on eggshells, making it
harder for Jayne to be honest with you.” I hoped the counseling
would work. As if her infidelity weren’t enough, she
now cried because she might have contracted the virus
that causes AIDS. “One of her lovers has slept around a lot
and shot up drugs,” Phil said. “He hasn’t seen a doctor in
ages because of his alcoholic tendencies, and on one occasion
he has said he could have the HIV virus. I assured
Jayne ... we will handle any result from the test one day
at a time.” The same thought might apply to his life with
Jayne. One day at a time. In the future, I hoped, she won’t
be so secretive about the dots on her computer screen.</p>

<div class='textbox1 width40'>

<p class='c018'>Greg and Sue, an Update</p>

</div>

<p class='c018'>I promised to update you on Greg and Sue. In late May
1995 Greg told me they were still moving ahead, except
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>that they’d decided it would be much easier for her if they
lived in the States. He would arrive at the Kansas City airport
on Wednesday, July 12, at 11:11 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> on American
Airlines. “My parents know,” he said. “On the surface
they’re bitchy about it—well, Mum is—but underneath
they’re cool with it. Especially my dad. He wants to come
too.” The older Smith had taken his family to Colorado
years earlier during a teacher-exchange program.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Work?” Greg went on. “Heck, I can do a lot of things.
My preference would be systems administrator or network
maintenance or even Internet guru-trainer.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Jokes about Adelaide’s sleepiness notwithstanding,
Greg would miss life down under. He cherished “the laid-back
nature of Australia. I spend a lot of time talking to
people, and in 99 of 100 cases, the shopkeeper will take
time out to have a chat about something going on in the
world. People are so open and friendly, gosh darnit. I
mean friendly, not lazy.” He would hate to give up, too, the
summer days at the sea, the music festivals of Adelaide,
and the programs of the Australian Broadcasting Commission
(“it’s government funded and turns up some really
cool and alternative stuff”). He would also miss
Australian Rules Football. “Mostly that’s an art form,”
Greg said. “Unlike NFL, every player has to be able to do
every other player’s job. There’s no offense or defense, and
it’s such a quick game that offense can turn into defense in
the blink of an eye.”</p>

<p class='c018'>E-mailing me on a rainy, thundery day—from
“America’s Heartland soon to be changed to America’s
Flood Plain”—Sue wrote: “Thoughts and hopes? Well, I
think the one thing I’ve had to struggle with lately is facing
up to the fear that we won’t get along. I know there’s a
chance. I’ve pretty much come to grips with it, so I think
that’s a good sign. I think we’ll work it out. I <em>hope</em> we will,
but that’s yet to be foretold—I’m just looking forward to finally
meeting my best friend.</p>

<p class='c018'><span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>“Where we’ll live is a little uncertain. I’m still making
the rounds of apartment complexes, trying to pick one
that I like, that I think he’ll like, and that is central to work
and school.</p>

<p class='c018'>“Telling people about Greg and me is a little tricky.
Most of the people I work with understand the basic concept
of the Internet, but don’t really understand the idea of
love at first talk session. I’ve pretty much just told people I
met Greg through friends. It just makes things a lot easier,
seeing as how I don’t have to explain things over and over
again. Maybe it’s a cop-out, but everyone knows how committed
I am to Greg regardless of how we met, and that’s
the important thing.</p>

<p class='c018'>“My father remains in the dark,” she said. “My mom
and I had a big discussion about things and she felt that
was the best way to handle things with him. I’m just taking
things one step at a time and dealing with them as
they come. I don’t want to throw it all in his face. He’s still
my daddy and has the best interest of his baby girl at
heart.” Earlier I’d told Sue that the hassles would vanish
when she met Greg, and she had agreed. “’Cept maybe the
fact Greg will be the tallest one at family reunions *grin*.
We’ll all be arguing over whose side of the volleyball net
he’s on. Mine of course. :-) *grin*.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Sue brought me up to date on work and school.
Recently she’d switched jobs and was now a file clerk for
an appliance company where the pay was higher and the
boss friendlier. “I can pretty much study during the slow
periods, which helps a great deal, *brandishes her grade
card*. Got it in the mail today—all A’s. I’m framing this
sucker—I actually pulled an A in algebra!”</p>

<p class='c018'>Her net.lover was getting a cc of the note to me. “Oh,
Greg,” she couldn’t resist adding, “I did some rearranging
for you today. I think you might be able to have a drawer
or two in the dresser *grin* just kidding. I cleaned my
room today and vacated one-half of my drawer space, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>major accomplishment almost tantamount to the A in algebra.
Just don’t look in the closet.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Redirecting the note back to me, Sue said: “I’ve always
been up front with Greg about who I am and how I look
and how I act and all that stuff. There’s going to be a lot of
rough edges we’ll need to smooth out, but I’d say we’ve got
a strong foundation to build on.” Concluding, Sue said she
had undergone a round of antibiotic-hormonal treatments
for an ulcer and gained weight. “The bad news is the
weight gain that went along with it. Least now I have the
bust to fill out my bathing suit.”</p>

<p class='c018'>A few days later I heard from Greg. Uh-oh. “To put it
bluntly,” he wrote, “I am not a happy camper.” I hoped I
hadn’t offended him. He and Sue had given so much of
themselves by sharing their letters with me. As I read on, I
found out the true reason for his dismay. It wasn’t an ever-curious
writer, or parents, or friends, or professional colleagues:
Greg had graduated from school and was doing
fine with temporary consulting work. “Visa—problem, big
problem. My visitor’s visa has been denied on the grounds
that I have insufficient reason to return to Australia. The
upshot of this is that our wedding and my travel plans
have been severely disrupted, delaying us by anything upwards
of about two months—gawd, I hate the sound of
that. I talked to Sue on the phone last night-her morning,
and we’re confident we can make it through this.”</p>

<p class='c018'>In character Greg was using the Net, and specifically
the newsgroup alt.visa.us, to help him cope with the
visa’crats.</p>

<p class='c018'>“It makes no sense to me that the U.S. government
won’t let in someone with a college degree that’s in demand
in this country,” Sue wrote, “and who speaks
English with such a sexy accent.”</p>

<p class='c018'>She had one last update later in June: “There’s one
thing you <em>have</em> to change in your chapter, and it’s just one
line. I went to the oncologist and he said I’d had enough tissue
regeneration that was healthy to give me some hope of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>being able to have kids. So I guess I just might get to explore
the world of labor pains and stretch marks after all. <em>Ugh.</em></p>

<p class='c018'>“And I know this sounds cheezy, but would you mind
altering names?”</p>

<p class='c018'>I was happy to oblige.</p>

<p class='c018'>“The press here in Kansas City,” Sue said, “has an absolute
field day with stuff like this. A guy got a mail-order
bride from Russia a year or so ago, and they had a five-part
segment on his life story in the paper and on the
news. I’d just rather not be looked at as someone who had
to go to a whole other country to find a date. Which is how
my father puts it *sigh*.”</p>

<p class='c018'>Oh, she had finally told. I wished I could see her father’s
face when Greg actually materialized in K.C. In the most
direct way Fred Olson* might understand how fortuitously
the Net had enlarged his daughter’s range of choices. What
counted wasn’t her finding a man, but the best man for
her—whether he was next-door or an ocean away.</p>

<hr class='c032' />

<p class='c018'>So that was how matters stood with Sue and Greg as
the presses were about to turn. I pondered the visa problem.
Damn the feds. Already the ayatollahs of the Senate
had been trying to turn the Internet into <cite>Mr. Roger’s
Neighborhood</cite>, while the crew in the White House was
crusading to make the Net more snoop-friendly. Now
Washington was getting in the way of both a romance and
a more definitive ending to my love chapter.</p>

<p class='c018'>As I typed those words I was listening to a RealAudio
replay of Senator James Exon pushing his censorship bill
on the Senate floor—an outrage that could harm not only
net.sex but net.love, given the major danger of abusive enforcement.
I loathed the man’s voice. The bullying selfrighteousness
struck me most of all. Exon’s tone was too
close to that of the late Senator Joseph McCarthy, the anti-communist
zealot from Wisconsin. In a very narrow way
I regretted that the Cold War was over. Now the bigots and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>bullies could focus on <em>domestic</em> troublemakers. Listening
to the digitized Exon, I heard him say that a Nebraskan
football coach had cheered him on. I reflected. Perhaps
the senator and the coach could do a RealAudio broadcast
from the locker rooms and show that in their territory
even the after-game talk was G-rated.</p>

<p class='c018'>My thoughts drifted. RealAudio reminded me of another
recent wrinkle, The Internet Phone, which let
Netfolks talk all over the world for free if they paid flat
rates for Net service. What a joy this might be for people
like Greg and Sue in the days before they rushed into each
other’s arms at the airport.</p>

<p class='c018'>There were a few catches. You needed a deluxe Net
connection, alas, which Sue lacked.</p>

<p class='c018'>So she and Greg would still have to reach out and
touch type to each other.</p>

<p class='c018'>That wasn’t so bad, actually. They were saving their
e-mail, and someday the files would remind them of all
the promise, all the anticipation, that the Net had held out
for them in the form of each other.</p>

<p class='c018'>Although I tinkered with The Internet Phone, I preferred
electronic mail, just as I’d normally favored international
Morse code over voice during my amateur
radio days. Now that art might be lost. Code didn’t matter
as much on the airwaves as before. The U.S. Coast Guard
was phasing it out. Any future SOS would apparently be in
bits and bytes rather than in dots and dashes, assuming
the initials remained at all. What would also perish—writing
on screens, eventually? Just what would happen
to typed words on the Net?</p>

<p class='c018'>Whether seriously or just as a discussion provoker, a
Seattle columnist had imagined the following: “It’s the
year 2020; your daughter Emily is nine years old and she
can’t read or write. Is this your worst nightmare about our
schools come true? Nope, Emily just doesn’t need to read
or write anymore.” That, of course, was exactly the kind of
nightmare I’d had on my mind in proposing TeleRead. We
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>needed graphics, not just words; but surely we could do
better than the Emily scenario.</p>

<p class='c018'>I’d asked Avodah Offit for comments on net.love rather
than on the effects of the technology in general, but she
couldn’t help warning about the almost inevitable transition
of the Net to sounds and images for all.</p>

<p class='c018'>Delighted by the renaissance of writing on networks,
she’d e-mailed me: “I think two-way TV will bring us
down to earth. It will be a loss rather than a gain to those
of us who enjoy using our imaginations and our writing
skills. Right now we all have an opportunity to use the literacy
that humans have spent thousands of years developing.”</p>

<p class='c018'>That was how I felt, too, whether the topic on the Net
was romance or gerbil care. An old pop lyric came to
mind: “These are the good old days.” I wondered about
the Snubbites and how they would have felt about Greg
and Sue and the many others the Net had brought together;
about the leather-jacketed kids up in Nova Scotia
who, for the first time in their lives, were looking forward
to <em>writing</em>, however rudimentary the elite Snubbites might
have considered the children’s prose; about all the love
letters that might go unwritten if TV-centric politicians let
Emily and friends live out their lives as illiterates without
electronic books or keyboards or equivalents.</p>

<p class='c018'>Some things were forever worth our being reactionaries
in an enlightened way. Literacy was one of them. We
mustn’t ever let the romance and civility of the written
word die on the Internet.</p>

<p class='c018'>Once again I recalled some e-mail Sue had sent, in
which she had not meant to be profound but was. Sue the
cancer survivor had reminded us of the need to enjoy
both Life and Net, and I wanted similar thoughts to grace
the screens of many lovers, in many countries, and for
many years. “*hugs greg* hold your horses sweetie,” she
had written, “I’m typing as fast as I can....”</p>

to cable for Internet purposes. Cable will probably be much better
than phone connections, the kind the <cite>N &amp; O</cite> uses. The best cure, of
course, would be laws that (1) assured the <cite>N &amp; O</cite> a place on local
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>cable and (2) also let the phone companies there go into the cable
business. Then the <cite>N &amp; O</cite> could choose between Time Warner and
its phone company allies of the present. Perhaps such laws will be
on the books by the time you’re reading this. Meanwhile, I’ll hardly
blame the people at Time Warner for unofficially talking up cable
for the Internet; as noted before, I’d do the same, given the technical
benefits.</p>

<p class='c018'>Errors deemed most likely to be the printer’s have been corrected, and
are noted here. The references are to the page and line in the original.
The following issues should be noted, along with the resolutions. FedEx
is referred to three times with the space (e.g. Fed Ex). These have been
removed where it occurs to facilitate text searches.</p>

<p class='c018'>The quotation at <a href='#c_143.12'>143.12</a> (see below) is misprinted, but it is not clear
how. We’ve chosen to retain the opening quote and provide the missing close.
A similar thing happens at <a href='#corr310.14'>310.14</a>. The sense would dictate that
the quotation continue from ‘really cool chapel’. The added closing quote is
harmless to the sense.</p>

<p class='c018'>On p. <a href='#corr259.12'>259</a>, the technical term ‘uuencoding’ is almost certainly meant for
‘unencoding’, which makes no sense in the context. We suspect an over-zealous
but not very technical editor/proofreader.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your

Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

This particular work is one of the few copyrighted individual works
included with the permission of the copyright holder.  Information on
the copyright owner for this particular work and the terms of use
imposed by the copyright holder on this work are set forth at the
beginning of this work.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
